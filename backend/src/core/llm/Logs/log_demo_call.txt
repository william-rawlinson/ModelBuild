What is Christmas?

================================================================================
Assistant:
Christmas is a major Christian holiday celebrated on December 25th that commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. It has evolved to include many secular traditions as well, such as gift-giving, decorating Christmas trees, hanging stockings, and the folklore of Santa Claus (also known as Father Christmas or Saint Nicholas) bringing gifts to children. 

The holiday season often features special meals, gatherings with family and friends, festive decorations with lights and ornaments, Christmas carols, and various cultural traditions that differ around the world. While Christmas has religious origins and significance for Christians, it's also celebrated as a cultural holiday by many non-Christians worldwide.
