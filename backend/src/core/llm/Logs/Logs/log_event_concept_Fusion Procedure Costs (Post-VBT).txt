User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

First, let me identify the health states that would be needed based on the transitions described:

1. VBT Index Procedure
2. Postoperative VBT
3. VBT Revision Procedure
4. Fusion Index Procedure
5. Postoperative Fusion Index
6. Fusion Revision 1 Procedure
7. Postoperative Fusion Revision 1
8. Fusion Revision 2 Procedure
9. Postoperative Fusion Revision 2
10. Ineligible for Further Fusion (absorbing state)

Now I'll create appropriate Events for this model:

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "One-time costs incurred when patients enter the model and undergo their initial procedure. Applies flow costs when patients transition from the starting state to either VBT Index Procedure or Fusion Index Procedure states, depending on treatment arm. Includes both device costs (vbt_index_device_cost or fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Costs": "Costs incurred when patients undergo VBT revision. Applies flow costs when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision Procedure state. Includes both device costs (vbt_revision_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Fusion Procedure Costs (Post-VBT)": "Costs incurred when VBT patients later undergo fusion. Applies flow costs when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Fusion Index Procedure. Includes both device costs (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Fusion Revision Procedure Costs": "Costs incurred when patients undergo fusion revision. Applies flow costs when patients transition to any fusion revision procedure state. Includes both device costs (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "QALYs accrued based on time spent in each health state. Applies occupation-based QALY impacts using the appropriate utility value for each health state (postop_vbt_utility for Postoperative VBT states, postop_fusion_utility for all Postoperative Fusion states). Procedure states would have zero utility as patients immediately transition to postoperative states.",
    
    "Procedure Disutility": "Temporary reduction in QALYs during procedure cycles. Applies flow-based QALY impacts when patients transition to any procedure state, representing the temporary disutility of undergoing surgery. This would be a negative adjustment to QALYs for the cycle in which a procedure occurs.",
    
    "Routine Follow-up Costs": "Ongoing healthcare costs for routine follow-up care. Applies occupation-based costs for patients in postoperative states, potentially differing between VBT and fusion patients based on follow-up requirements.",
    
    "Complication Costs": "Costs associated with managing complications that don't require revision surgery. Applies occupation-based costs in postoperative states, potentially at different rates for different procedures.",
    
    "Terminal Care Costs": "Additional costs that might be incurred when patients reach the Ineligible for Further Fusion state. Applies flow-based costs when patients transition to this absorbing state."
}
</event_recommendations>

Note: Some of these events (particularly "Routine Follow-up Costs", "Complication Costs", and "Terminal Care Costs") may require additional parameters not currently specified in the available parameters list. The model would need to be expanded with these parameters if these aspects are important to capture.

The events are designed to avoid double-counting while ensuring all relevant costs and utilities are captured. Each event represents a distinct mechanism or trigger for costs or QALYs, and the implementation would use the appropriate combination of occupation and flow impacts.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely, defining what it represents and how it should work
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code using the provided mechanics
3. If needed, I'll add additional parameters using the specified format

I've read through the Event mechanics and understand how to:
- Create calculation functions that return EventImpact objects
- Use initialise_impact() to create the impact object
- Add occupancy impacts for costs and QALYs
- Add flow impacts for costs and QALYs
- Reference the calculation function in an EventSpec

I also understand how to add additional parameters when needed, using the specified JSON format within <additional_parameters> tags.

I'm ready to proceed with implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Index Procedure Costs - Conceptual Plan

This event captures the one-time costs incurred when patients undergo their initial procedure (either VBT or spinal fusion). These costs should be applied as flow costs when patients transition from their initial procedure state to the corresponding postoperative state.

## Key Considerations:
- The model has two initial procedure states: "VBT Index Procedure" and "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure"
- Patients transition from these states to "Postoperative VBT" and "Postoperative Fusion" respectively
- The costs include both device costs and non-device costs
- For VBT: vbt_index_device_cost + non_device_cost
- For Spinal Fusion: fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost

## Parameters to Use:
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (applies to all procedures)
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (for fusion procedures)
- `vbt_index_device_cost`: $50,615 (for initial VBT procedure)

## Implementation Plan:
1. Initialize the impact object
2. Calculate total VBT index procedure cost = vbt_index_device_cost + non_device_cost
3. Calculate total fusion index procedure cost = fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost
4. Apply these costs as flow impacts:
   - From "VBT Index Procedure" to "Postoperative VBT"
   - From "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" to "Postoperative Fusion"

## Assumptions:
- The costs are applied once when patients transition from the procedure state to the postoperative state
- All patients in the procedure state will transition to the corresponding postoperative state in the same cycle (as indicated by procedure_to_postop_prob = 1.0)
- The costs are the same regardless of patient characteristics or time in the model

I don't need any additional parameters for this event as all required parameters are already available in the model.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

    # Calculate total costs for each procedure type
    vbt_index_total_cost = float(context.params["vbt_index_device_cost"]) + float(context.params["non_device_cost"])
    fusion_index_total_cost = float(context.params["fusion_device_cost"]) + float(context.params["non_device_cost"])
    
    # Apply costs as flow impacts when patients transition from procedure to postoperative states
    impact.cost_flow.add("VBT Index Procedure", "Postoperative VBT", vbt_index_total_cost)
    impact.cost_flow.add("Spinal Fusion Index Procedure", "Postoperative Fusion", fusion_index_total_cost)
    
    return impact

    event_name="Index Procedure Costs",
    tags={"cost", "procedure"},
    calculation_function=get_index_procedure_costs_impact,
)

VBT Revision Procedure Costs
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Costs incurred when patients undergo VBT revision. Applies flow costs when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision Procedure state. Includes both device costs (vbt_revision_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model.

# VBT Revision Procedure Costs - Conceptual Plan

This event captures the costs incurred when patients undergo a VBT revision procedure. These costs should be applied as flow costs when patients transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "VBT Revision" state.

## Key Considerations:
- Patients in the "Postoperative VBT" state may require a revision of their VBT procedure
- When this occurs, they transition to the "VBT Revision" state
- The costs include both device costs and non-device costs
- For VBT revision: vbt_revision_device_cost + non_device_cost
- After the revision procedure, patients will transition to a postoperative state

## Parameters to Use:
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (applies to all procedures)
- `vbt_revision_device_cost`: $8,804 (for VBT revision procedures)

## Implementation Plan:
1. Initialize the impact object
2. Calculate total VBT revision procedure cost = vbt_revision_device_cost + non_device_cost
3. Apply this cost as a flow impact from "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision"

## Assumptions:
- The costs are applied once when patients transition from the postoperative state to the revision state
- After the revision procedure, patients will return to the "Postoperative VBT" state (based on the model health states provided)
- I notice that there's no explicit "Postoperative VBT Revision" state in the model health states list, so I'm assuming patients return to the "Postoperative VBT" state after a VBT revision

User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

# Fusion Procedure Costs (Post-VBT) - Conceptual Plan

This event captures the costs incurred when patients who previously had VBT later undergo a spinal fusion procedure. These costs should be applied as flow costs when patients transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state.

## Key Considerations:
- Patients in the "Postoperative VBT" state may later require a spinal fusion procedure
- When this occurs, they transition to the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state
- The costs include both device costs and non-device costs
- For fusion procedure: fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost
- After the fusion procedure, patients will transition to the "Postoperative Fusion" state

## Parameters to Use:
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (applies to all procedures)
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (for fusion procedures)

## Implementation Plan:
1. Initialize the impact object
2. Calculate total fusion procedure cost = fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost
3. Apply this cost as a flow impact from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure"

## Assumptions:
- The costs are applied once when patients transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state
- This represents patients who initially had VBT but later require a spinal fusion
- After the fusion procedure, patients will transition to the "Postoperative Fusion" state (based on the model health states provided)
- The cost of fusion is the same whether it's an initial procedure or following a VBT procedure

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required parameters are already available in the model.
