User:
We are going to work together to design the health states for a cohort Markov model.
Your task is to propose a suitable list of health states based on the model description and the available parameters.

Key objective: MINIMAL state space
- Your primary goal is to propose the smallest (minimal) set of health states that can faithfully represent the model
  described and can be parameterised using the available parameters.
- Do NOT add states “just in case”. Only add a state if it is required to represent different costs, QALYs, or transition
  structure that cannot be represented otherwise.

Respect the model description, but do not be constrained by it
- The model description may explicitly suggest a set of health states (e.g., “use states A, B, C”).
- If that proposed set is not sufficient or is mismatched with the required costs/QALYs/transitions, you MUST modify it.
  It is acceptable to add, remove, merge, or rename states to achieve a coherent and minimal state space, but only if there is a good reason to do so.

When tunnel states are required (important)
- If costs or QALYs depend on “time since entering” a state(e.g., higher cost in the second cycle after surgery, different
  utility in the third year post-event, or different transition risk in cycles 2+ after an event), a standard Markov
  state will not be sufficient. 
- In those cases you should introduce TUNNEL STATES:
  - Tunnel states are time-limited states that represent being in a condition for a specific duration since entry.
  - Patients pass through them sequentially (e.g., PostOp_0 → PostOp_1 → PostOp_LongTerm), enabling different per-cycle
    occupancy costs/QALYs and/or different transition risks by time-since-entry.
  - Use tunnel states only when necessary (i.e., when time-since-entry changes costs/QALYs/transition behavior).
- IMPORTANTLY, we do not need tunnel states for costs / QALYs that are incurred upon transition to a state, these can be handled by simply associating cost and QALY impacts with transitions

Tunnel state naming convention (use this exactly)
- If a state requires tunnel structure, use:
    "<BASE_STATE>__tunnel_<k>"
  for k = 0, 1, 2, ... for sequential cycles after entry, and then a final non-tunnel long-term state:
    "<BASE_STATE>__long_term"
Examples:
- "PostOp__tunnel_0", "PostOp__tunnel_1", "PostOp__long_term"
- "Revision__tunnel_0", "Revision__long_term"

Output requirements
1) Provide a short rationale explaining:
   - why the proposed states are sufficient and minimal
   - where (if anywhere) tunnel states were required and why
2) Return ONLY the final ordered list of health state names inside:
   <model_health_states></model_health_states>
   Use a JSON array of strings inside the tags.

Here is the model description and available parameters:

<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

Assistant:
I'll design a minimal set of health states for this Markov model based on the description and available parameters.

## Rationale

Looking at the model description and parameters, I need to capture:

1. Different surgical procedures (VBT and fusion)
2. Post-operative states with different utilities
3. Revision states
4. Time-dependent transition probabilities (first quarter vs. subsequent quarters)

The key insight is that we need tunnel states for the post-operative periods because transition probabilities differ between the first quarter and subsequent quarters after procedures. Specifically:
- After VBT, the probability of transitioning to fusion differs in the first quarter vs. subsequent quarters
- After fusion, the probability of revision differs in the first quarter vs. subsequent quarters

I'll create tunnel states for these post-operative periods to accurately model these time-dependent transitions.

The model also mentions up to two fusion revisions before becoming ineligible for further revisions, so I'll include states for each revision level.
