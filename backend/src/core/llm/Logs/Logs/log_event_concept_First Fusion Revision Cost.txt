User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index VBT Procedure Cost": "Applies the one-time cost of the initial VBT procedure (device cost + non-device cost) when patients enter the model in the VBT arm. This is a flow impact from the starting state to the post-VBT state.",
    
    "Index Fusion Procedure Cost": "Applies the one-time cost of the initial fusion procedure (device cost + non-device cost) when patients enter the model in the fusion arm. This is a flow impact from the starting state to the post-fusion state.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of VBT revision (revision device cost + non-device cost) when patients transition from post-VBT state to VBT revision state. This is a flow impact.",
    
    "VBT to Fusion Conversion Cost": "Applies the cost of converting from VBT to fusion (fusion device cost + non-device cost) when patients transition from post-VBT state to post-fusion state. This is a flow impact.",
    
    "First Fusion Revision Cost": "Applies the cost of the first fusion revision (fusion device cost + non-device cost) when patients transition from post-fusion state to first fusion revision state. This is a flow impact.",
    
    "Second Fusion Revision Cost": "Applies the cost of the second fusion revision (fusion device cost + non-device cost) when patients transition from first fusion revision state to second fusion revision state. This is a flow impact.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies the appropriate utility values for each health state (postop_vbt_utility for post-VBT states, postop_fusion_utility for post-fusion states) multiplied by the cycle length. This is an occupancy impact that applies QALYs based on which health state patients occupy during each cycle.",
    
    "Temporary Utility Decrements": "Applies temporary utility decrements during the cycle immediately following any surgical procedure (index or revision). This accounts for the recovery period after surgery. This is an occupancy impact that reduces QALYs in the cycle following a procedure.",
    
    "Routine Follow-up Costs": "Applies routine follow-up costs for all patients based on their current health state. This is an occupancy impact that applies different follow-up costs depending on whether patients are in post-VBT or post-fusion states.",
    
    "Complication Costs": "Applies costs for managing complications that may occur in any health state. This is an occupancy impact that applies costs based on complication rates in different health states."
}
</event_recommendations>

Note: Based on the available parameters, I've included events that cover the core costs and utilities described in the model. The "Temporary Utility Decrements" and "Routine Follow-up Costs" and "Complication Costs" events are suggested based on typical considerations in surgical intervention models, though specific parameter values for these aren't provided in the available parameters list. If these are needed, additional parameters would need to be defined.

The events focus on separating distinct mechanisms (surgical procedures, health state occupancy) while avoiding duplication of logic. Each surgical procedure has its own event to capture its unique costs, while utilities are handled through a single event that applies the appropriate values based on health state occupancy.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code using the provided mechanics

I've noted the Event mechanics, including how to:
- Initialize an impact object
- Add occupancy impacts (costs and QALYs applied to states)
- Add flow impacts (costs and QALYs applied to transitions)

I also understand that I can add additional parameters if needed, using the specified JSON format within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Conceptual Plan for "Index VBT Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the one-time cost of the initial VBT procedure when patients transition from the "VBT Index Procedure" state to the "Postoperative VBT" state. This represents the cost incurred during the initial VBT surgery.

## Calculation Components
1. The total cost of the index VBT procedure consists of:
   - Device cost: Available as "vbt_index_device_cost" parameter ($50,615)
   - Non-device cost: Available as "non_device_cost" parameter ($28,616)
   - Total cost = Device cost + Non-device cost = $79,231

2. This cost should be applied as a flow impact when patients move from "VBT Index Procedure" to "Postoperative VBT"

## Implementation Plan
- Initialize an impact object
- Add a cost flow impact from "VBT Index Procedure" to "Postoperative VBT" with the total cost value
- Return the impact object

## Parameters Used
- "vbt_index_device_cost": $50,615 - The device cost for the index VBT procedure
- "non_device_cost": $28,616 - The non-device costs associated with all procedures

## Assumptions
- The cost is applied only once when patients transition from the index procedure state to the postoperative state
- All patients in the VBT arm will incur this cost as they all start in the "VBT Index Procedure" state and move to "Postoperative VBT"
- No additional parameters are needed as all required costs are already available in the parameter set

No additional parameters are required for this event.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec


================================================================================

For the "Index VBT Procedure Cost" event, I'll implement a function that applies the cost as a flow impact when patients transition from the "VBT Index Procedure" state to the "Postoperative VBT" state.

    # Calculate total cost of index VBT procedure
    vbt_device_cost = float(context.params["vbt_index_device_cost"])
    non_device_cost = float(context.params["non_device_cost"])
    total_cost = vbt_device_cost + non_device_cost
    
    # Apply cost as a flow impact from index procedure to postoperative state
    impact.cost_flow.add("VBT Index Procedure", "Postoperative VBT", total_cost)
    
    return impact

index_vbt_procedure_cost_event = EventSpec(

## Overview
This event will apply the one-time cost of the initial spinal fusion procedure when patients transition from the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state to the "Postoperative Fusion" state. This represents the cost incurred during the initial fusion surgery for patients in the fusion arm.

## Calculation Components
1. The total cost of the index fusion procedure consists of:
   - Device cost: Available as "fusion_device_cost" parameter ($17,200)
   - Non-device cost: Available as "non_device_cost" parameter ($28,616)
   - Total cost = Device cost + Non-device cost = $45,816

2. This cost should be applied as a flow impact when patients move from "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" to "Postoperative Fusion"

## Implementation Plan
- Initialize an impact object
- Add a cost flow impact from "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" to "Postoperative Fusion" with the total cost value
- Return the impact object

## Parameters Used
- "fusion_device_cost": $17,200 - The device cost for the fusion procedure
- "non_device_cost": $28,616 - The non-device costs associated with all procedures

## Assumptions
- The cost is applied only once when patients transition from the index procedure state to the postoperative state
- All patients in the fusion arm will incur this cost as they all start in the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state and move to "Postoperative Fusion"
- No additional parameters are needed as all required costs are already available in the parameter set

No additional parameters are required for this event.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Target Event:
<current_event_name>
VBT Revision Procedure Cost
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Applies the cost of VBT revision (revision device cost + non-device cost) when patients transition from post-VBT state to VBT revision state. This is a flow impact.
</current_event_description>

Context:
<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT Revision Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the one-time cost of a VBT revision procedure when patients transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "VBT Revision" state. This represents the cost incurred when a patient who previously had a VBT procedure requires a revision of that procedure.

## Calculation Components
1. The total cost of the VBT revision procedure consists of:
   - Revision device cost: Available as "vbt_revision_device_cost" parameter ($8,804)
   - Non-device cost: Available as "non_device_cost" parameter ($28,616)
   - Total cost = Revision device cost + Non-device cost = $37,420

2. This cost should be applied as a flow impact when patients move from "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision"

## Implementation Plan
- Initialize an impact object
- Add a cost flow impact from "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision" with the total cost value
- Return the impact object

## Parameters Used
- "vbt_revision_device_cost": $8,804 - The device cost for VBT revision
- "non_device_cost": $28,616 - The non-device costs associated with all procedures

## Assumptions
- The cost is applied only once when patients transition from the postoperative VBT state to the VBT revision state
- After VBT revision, patients would likely return to a postoperative state, but this event only captures the cost of the revision procedure itself
- No additional parameters are needed as all required costs are already available in the parameter set

No additional parameters are required for this event.

# Conceptual Plan for "First Fusion Revision Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the one-time cost of the first fusion revision procedure when patients transition from the "Postoperative Fusion" state to the "Fusion Revision 1" state. This represents the cost incurred when a patient who previously had a fusion procedure requires a revision of that procedure for the first time.

## Calculation Components
1. The total cost of the first fusion revision procedure consists of:
   - Fusion device cost: Available as "fusion_device_cost" parameter ($17,200)
   - Non-device cost: Available as "non_device_cost" parameter ($28,616)
   - Total cost = Fusion device cost + Non-device cost = $45,816

2. This cost should be applied as a flow impact when patients move from "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1"

## Implementation Plan
- Initialize an impact object
- Add a cost flow impact from "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1" with the total cost value
- Return the impact object
