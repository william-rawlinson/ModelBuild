User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs
See provided data

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model. For VBT arm, applies VBT index device cost plus non-device costs. For Fusion arm, applies fusion device cost plus non-device costs. These are one-time costs applied as flow impacts when patients transition from the index procedure states.",
    
    "VBT Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo VBT revision. Includes VBT revision device cost plus non-device costs. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state.",
    
    "Fusion Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo fusion revision procedures. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. Applied as flow impacts when patients transition to Fusion Revision 1 or Fusion Revision 2 states.",
    
    "VBT to Fusion Conversion Costs": "Applies costs when VBT patients later undergo an index fusion procedure. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Postoperative Fusion state.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values based on patients' current health states. Different utility values for postoperative VBT (0.925) and postoperative fusion (0.875) states. Utilities are applied as occupation impacts, adjusted by cycle length to convert to QALYs.",
    
    "Procedure Recovery Disutility": "Captures temporary utility decrements during procedure and immediate recovery periods. Applied as flow impacts when patients transition into any procedure state (index or revision). This accounts for the temporary decrease in quality of life during surgical procedures and recovery.",
    
    "Postoperative Follow-up Costs": "Captures routine follow-up costs in the postoperative periods. Applied as occupation impacts for patients in postoperative states. May vary between VBT and fusion patients based on different monitoring requirements.",
    
    "Long-term Complication Costs": "Captures costs associated with managing long-term complications in each health state. Applied as occupation impacts that may differ between VBT and fusion patients based on different complication profiles.",
    
    "Ineligible State Costs": "Applies costs specific to patients who reach the 'Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision' state. These patients may require alternative management approaches or have higher ongoing care needs. Applied as occupation impacts."
}
</event_recommendations>

These events cover the key cost and utility impacts in the model while following the principles of good event design. Each event represents a distinct real-world mechanism, avoids duplication of logic, and separates occupation impacts (ongoing costs/utilities while in states) from flow impacts (one-time costs/utilities when transitioning between states).

The events account for all the procedures described in the model (index procedures, revisions, and conversions from VBT to fusion) and their associated costs and utility impacts. I've also included events for postoperative follow-up and long-term complications, which are typical considerations in surgical intervention models.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code. You should not add parameters that are simply conversions of other parameters, as these are not true independent parameters. Instead perform the conversion calculation in your code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code

I've read through the Event mechanics and understand how to:
- Create calculation functions that return EventImpact objects
- Use the helper functions to initialize impacts and add cost/QALY impacts for both occupancy and flow
- Define EventSpec objects that reference the calculation functions

I also understand that I can add additional parameters if needed by providing them in a JSON array within <additional_parameters> tags during the conceptualization phase. These parameters should have the required fields (parameter_name, value, description, distribution, standard_error, and optionally notes).

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Index Procedure Costs Event Conceptualization

## Event Purpose
This event applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model and transition from their index procedure state to the corresponding postoperative state. These are one-time costs applied as flow impacts.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Apply costs as flow impacts for transitions from index procedure states to postoperative states:
   - For VBT: Apply cost when transitioning from "VBT Index Procedure" to "Postoperative VBT"
   - For Fusion: Apply cost when transitioning from "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" to "Postoperative Fusion"

## Parameters Required
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (already available)
- `vbt_index_device_cost`: $50,615.00 (already available)
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200.00 (already available)

## Calculations
- Total VBT index procedure cost = vbt_index_device_cost + non_device_cost = $50,615.00 + $28,616.00 = $79,231.00
- Total fusion index procedure cost = fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost = $17,200.00 + $28,616.00 = $45,816.00

## Implementation Approach
I will create a calculation function that:
1. Initializes an impact object
2. Calculates the total cost for each procedure type by adding device and non-device costs
3. Adds flow impacts for transitions from index procedure states to postoperative states
4. Returns the impact object

No additional parameters are needed as all required parameters are already available.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Target Event:
<current_event_name>
VBT Revision Costs
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Applies costs when patients undergo VBT revision. Includes VBT revision device cost plus non-device costs. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state.
</current_event_description>

Context:
<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model.

# VBT Revision Costs Event Conceptualization

## Event Purpose
This event applies costs when patients undergo VBT revision surgery. These costs include the VBT revision device cost plus non-device costs. The costs are applied as flow impacts when patients transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "VBT Revision" state.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Calculate the total cost for VBT revision by adding:
   - VBT revision device cost (parameter: `vbt_revision_device_cost`)
   - Non-device costs (parameter: `non_device_cost`)
3. Apply this total cost as a flow impact for the transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision"
4. Return the impact object

## Parameters Required
- `vbt_revision_device_cost`: $8,804.00 (already available)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (already available)

## Calculations
- Total VBT revision cost = vbt_revision_device_cost + non_device_cost = $8,804.00 + $28,616.00 = $37,420.00

## Implementation Approach
I will create a calculation function that:
1. Initializes an impact object
2. Calculates the total cost for VBT revision by adding device and non-device costs
3. Adds a flow impact for the transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision"
4. Returns the impact object

## Additional Considerations
- Based on the model health states, I need to determine where patients go after VBT revision. Looking at the model description, it appears they would return to the "Postoperative VBT" state after revision. However, this is not explicitly stated in the model description.
- For this event, I only need to capture the cost of the revision procedure itself, not any subsequent transitions.

No additional parameters are needed as all required parameters are already available.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

## Event Purpose
This event applies costs when patients undergo fusion revision procedures. These costs include the fusion device cost plus non-device costs. The costs are applied as flow impacts when patients transition to the "Fusion Revision 1" or "Fusion Revision 2" states.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Calculate the total cost for fusion revision by adding:
   - Fusion device cost (parameter: `fusion_device_cost`)
   - Non-device costs (parameter: `non_device_cost`)
3. Apply this total cost as flow impacts for the following transitions:
   - From "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1"
   - From "Postoperative Fusion Revision 1" to "Fusion Revision 2"
4. Return the impact object

## Parameters Required
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200.00 (already available)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (already available)

## Calculations
- Total fusion revision cost = fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost = $17,200.00 + $28,616.00 = $45,816.00

## Implementation Approach
I will create a calculation function that:
1. Initializes an impact object
2. Calculates the total cost for fusion revision by adding device and non-device costs
3. Adds flow impacts for transitions to both "Fusion Revision 1" and "Fusion Revision 2" states
4. Returns the impact object

## Additional Considerations
- Based on the model health states and description, patients can undergo up to two fusion revisions before becoming ineligible for further revisions.
- The cost for each fusion revision is assumed to be the same (same device and non-device costs).
- The model description indicates that patients move from "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1" and from "Postoperative Fusion Revision 1" to "Fusion Revision 2".

No additional parameters are needed as all required parameters are already available.
