User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs
See provided data

Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

First, let me identify the health states from the model description:
1. VBT Index Procedure
2. Postoperative VBT
3. VBT Revision
4. Index Fusion Procedure
5. Postoperative Index Fusion
6. First Fusion Revision
7. Postoperative First Fusion Revision
8. Second Fusion Revision
9. Postoperative Second Fusion Revision
10. Ineligible Fusion (absorbing state)
11. Death (absorbing state)

Now I'll create appropriate Events for the model:

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model. For VBT arm, applies VBT index device cost plus non-device procedure cost. For fusion arm, applies fusion device cost plus non-device procedure cost. This is a one-time cost applied as a flow impact when patients enter their respective index procedure states.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo VBT revision. Includes VBT revision device cost plus non-device procedure cost. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state.",
    
    "Index Fusion After VBT Costs": "Applies costs when VBT patients require subsequent fusion. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device procedure cost. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Index Fusion Procedure state.",
    
    "Fusion Revision Costs": "Applies costs for fusion revision procedures. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device procedure cost. Applied as flow impacts when patients transition to any fusion revision state (First Fusion Revision or Second Fusion Revision).",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values based on patients' current health states. Postoperative VBT patients receive postop_vbt_utility, while patients in any postoperative fusion state receive postop_fusion_utility. Applied as occupancy impacts, multiplied by cycle length to convert to QALYs.",
    
    "Background Mortality": "Applies the background mortality rate across all health states. Converts annual mortality rate to quarterly probability and applies as flow impacts from any non-death state to the Death state.",
    
    "Procedure Disutility": "Captures temporary reduction in quality of life during procedure and immediate recovery periods. Applied as a one-time QALY decrement (flow impact) when patients transition into any procedure state (index or revision).",
    
    "Ongoing Healthcare Costs": "Captures routine healthcare costs that vary by health state. Applied as occupancy impacts to reflect different resource utilization patterns in different postoperative states."
}
</event_recommendations>

Note: Based on the available parameters, I've included the core events needed for the model. The "Procedure Disutility" and "Ongoing Healthcare Costs" events are suggested additions that would make the model more comprehensive, though specific parameter values for these aren't provided in the current parameter set. If you'd like to implement these events, we would need to define additional parameters for them.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code. You should not add parameters that are simply conversions of other parameters, as these are not true independent parameters. Instead perform the conversion calculation in your code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely, defining what it represents and how it should work
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code using the provided mechanics
3. If needed, I'll suggest additional parameters using the specified format

I've reviewed the Event mechanics and understand how to:
- Create calculation functions that take an EventContext and return an EventImpact
- Initialize impacts using initialise_impact()
- Add occupancy impacts for costs and QALYs to specific states
- Add flow impacts for costs and QALYs to specific state transitions
- Reference these calculation functions in EventSpec objects

I also understand that I can suggest additional parameters if needed, and that I should avoid creating parameters that are just conversions of existing ones.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these. Please note you will have access to the time horizon (in years) and cycle length (in years) as further variables.

# Conceptual Plan for "Index Procedure Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model. These costs are one-time costs that occur at the beginning of treatment, representing the costs of the index procedures (either VBT or spinal fusion).

## Calculation Approach
1. The event will use flow impacts to apply costs when patients transition from their initial state to the index procedure states.
2. For the VBT arm, the cost will be the sum of:
   - VBT index device cost (`vbt_index_device_cost` = $50,615)
   - Non-device procedure cost (`non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616)
   - Total VBT index procedure cost = $79,231

3. For the fusion arm, the cost will be the sum of:
   - Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost` = $17,200)
   - Non-device procedure cost (`non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616)
   - Total fusion index procedure cost = $45,816

## Implementation Details
- Since patients start directly in the index procedure states (`VBT_Index` or `Fusion_Index`), we need to apply these costs as patients enter these states.
- However, the model doesn't have a pre-procedure state to create a flow impact from.
- Therefore, I'll need to add a parameter to identify the initial cycle and apply these costs as occupancy impacts only in the first cycle.

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_index_device_cost` = $50,615
- `fusion_device_cost` = $17,200
- `non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616

## Additional Parameters Needed
I need to add a parameter to identify the initial cycle:

<additional_parameters>
[
  {
    "parameter_name": "initial_state_indicator",
    "value": 1,
    "description": "Flag to indicate the initial cycle (1 for initial cycle, 0 otherwise)",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "This parameter will be used to apply index procedure costs only in the first cycle"
  }
]
</additional_parameters>

## Assumptions
1. Index procedure costs are applied only once at the beginning of the model.
2. The costs are the same regardless of patient characteristics.
3. The costs are applied in full at the time of the procedure (no spreading of costs over multiple cycles).
4. The initial_state_indicator parameter will be set to 1 for the first cycle and 0 for all subsequent cycles by the model runner.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Access the cycle number by using context.cycle
- Access the treatment name by using context.treatment
- Access the model health states using context.health_states
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use context.cycle_length_years, and context.time_horizon_years if you need to access these variable values
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Assistant:
Let me implement the Index Procedure Costs Event as conceptualized.

For this event, I need to:

    tags={"cost", "procedure"},

Brilliant. Now we are going to generate some helpful metadata for the event. 

Requirements:
- Always include the metadata within <metadata></metadata> tags.
- Include only a JSON within the <metadata> tags

<current_event_name>
VBT Revision Procedure Costs
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Applies costs when patients undergo VBT revision. Includes VBT revision device cost plus non-device procedure cost. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state.
</current_event_description>

Context:
<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT Revision Procedure Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the costs associated with VBT revision procedures. These costs are incurred when patients transition from a postoperative VBT state to the VBT revision state, representing the surgical costs of revising a previously performed VBT procedure.

## Calculation Approach
1. The event will use flow impacts to apply costs when patients transition from postoperative VBT states to the VBT revision state.
2. The total cost for a VBT revision procedure will be the sum of:
   - VBT revision device cost (`vbt_revision_device_cost` = $8,804)
   - Non-device procedure cost (`non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616)
   - Total VBT revision procedure cost = $37,420

## Implementation Details
- Apply the cost as a flow impact when patients transition from either `PostVBT__tunnel_0` or `PostVBT__long_term` to the `VBT_Revision` state.
- The cost is applied only once per transition, at the time the revision procedure occurs.
- This event only applies to the VBT treatment arm, as fusion patients would not undergo VBT revision.

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_revision_device_cost` = $8,804
- `non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616

## Assumptions
1. VBT revision costs are the same regardless of when the revision occurs (no time-dependent variation in costs).
2. The costs are applied in full at the time of the revision procedure (no spreading of costs over multiple cycles).
3. Patients can transition to VBT revision from either the tunnel state or the long-term postoperative VBT state.
4. The revision costs are the same for all patients requiring VBT revision.

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required parameters are already available.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Access the cycle number by using context.cycle
- Access the treatment name by using context.treatment
- Access the model health states using context.health_states
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use context.cycle_length_years, and context.time_horizon_years if you need to access these variable values
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

# Conceptual Plan for "Index Fusion After VBT Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the costs associated with index fusion procedures that are performed after a patient has already undergone VBT. These costs are incurred when patients transition from a postoperative VBT state to the index fusion procedure state, representing the surgical costs of performing a spinal fusion after a previous VBT procedure.

## Calculation Approach
1. The event will use flow impacts to apply costs when patients transition from postoperative VBT states to the index fusion procedure state.
2. The total cost for an index fusion procedure after VBT will be the sum of:
   - Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost` = $17,200)
   - Non-device procedure cost (`non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616)
   - Total index fusion after VBT cost = $45,816

## Implementation Details
- Apply the cost as a flow impact when patients transition from either `PostVBT__tunnel_0` or `PostVBT__long_term` to the `Fusion_Index` state.
- The cost is applied only once per transition, at the time the fusion procedure occurs.
- This event is relevant only for patients in the VBT treatment arm who subsequently require fusion.
- Patients can transition to fusion from either the tunnel state or the long-term postoperative VBT state.

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost` = $17,200
- `non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616

## Assumptions
1. Index fusion costs after VBT are the same as initial fusion costs for patients in the fusion arm.
2. The costs are applied in full at the time of the fusion procedure (no spreading of costs over multiple cycles).
3. The fusion costs are the same regardless of when the fusion occurs after VBT (no time-dependent variation in costs).
4. The fusion costs are the same for all patients requiring fusion after VBT.
5. Patients can transition to fusion from either the tunnel state or the long-term postoperative VBT state.

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required parameters are already available.

15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state.

# Conceptual Plan for "Fusion Revision Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the costs associated with fusion revision procedures. These costs are incurred when patients transition to any fusion revision state, representing the surgical costs of revising a previously performed spinal fusion procedure. The model allows for up to two fusion revisions before a patient becomes ineligible for further fusion procedures.

## Calculation Approach
1. The event will use flow impacts to apply costs when patients transition to fusion revision states.
2. The total cost for a fusion revision procedure will be the sum of:
   - Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost` = $17,200)
   - Non-device procedure cost (`non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616)
   - Total fusion revision procedure cost = $45,816

## Implementation Details
- Apply the cost as a flow impact when patients transition to either the first fusion revision state (`Fusion_Revision1`) or the second fusion revision state (`Fusion_Revision2`).
- For the first fusion revision, apply costs when transitioning from either `PostFusion_Index__tunnel_0` or `PostFusion_Index__long_term` to `Fusion_Revision1`.
- For the second fusion revision, apply costs when transitioning from either `PostFusion_Revision1__tunnel_0` or `PostFusion_Revision1__long_term` to `Fusion_Revision2`.
- The cost is applied only once per transition, at the time the revision procedure occurs.
- This event applies to both treatment arms (VBT and fusion) as patients in either arm may eventually require fusion revisions.

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost` = $17,200
- `non_device_procedure_cost` = $28,616

## Assumptions
1. Fusion revision costs are the same for both first and second revisions.
2. The costs are applied in full at the time of the revision procedure (no spreading of costs over multiple cycles).
3. The fusion revision costs are the same regardless of when the revision occurs (no time-dependent variation in costs).
4. The fusion revision costs are the same for all patients requiring fusion revision.
5. Patients can transition to fusion revision from either the tunnel state or the long-term postoperative state.
6. The costs for transitioning to the ineligible fusion state are not included in this event (as this represents becoming ineligible for further procedures rather than undergoing a procedure).

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required parameters are already available.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Access the cycle number by using context.cycle
- Access the treatment name by using context.treatment
- Access the model health states using context.health_states
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use context.cycle_length_years, and context.time_horizon_years if you need to access these variable values
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Let me implement the Fusion Revision Costs event as conceptualized.

For this event, I need to:
1. Apply costs when patients transition to either the first or second fusion revision states
2. Calculate the total cost as the sum of fusion device cost and non-device procedure cost
3. Use flow impacts since these costs occur only during the transition
4. Apply the same costs for both first and second fusion revisions

<final_code>
def get_fusion_revision_costs_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    """

    Includes fusion device cost plus non-device procedure cost.

    (First Fusion Revision or Second Fusion Revision).

    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    
    # Calculate total fusion revision procedure cost
    fusion_revision_cost = context.params["fusion_device_cost"] + context.params["non_device_procedure_cost"]
    
    # Apply costs as flow impacts for transitions to first fusion revision
    impact.cost_flow.add("PostFusion_Index__tunnel_0", "Fusion_Revision1", fusion_revision_cost)
    impact.cost_flow.add("PostFusion_Index__long_term", "Fusion_Revision1", fusion_revision_cost)

    impact.cost_flow.add("PostFusion_Revision1__long_term", "Fusion_Revision2", fusion_revision_cost)
    
    return impact

User:
Brilliant. Now we are going to generate some helpful metadata for the event. 

Requirements:
- Always include the metadata within <metadata></metadata> tags.
- Include only a JSON within the <metadata> tags
- the JSON should have the fields:
    - 'description': a brief description of the real-world mechanism/trigger the Event represents, and the cost and/or QALY impact associated with the event (including what under conditions/rate this is applied)
    - 'assumptions': Any important calculation assumptions made in the Event
