User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, calculate transitions, or implement other model mechanics.   Assume all transition probabilities and state occupancies have already been calculated, as they have been elsewhere.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs
See provided data



Utilities
Health state utilities
See provided data.

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model. For VBT arm, applies VBT index device cost plus non-device costs. For fusion arm, applies fusion device cost plus non-device costs. This is a one-time flow impact when patients enter their respective index procedure states.",
    
    "VBT Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients transition from postoperative VBT state to VBT revision. Includes VBT revision device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact for the specific transition.",
    
    "Index Fusion After VBT Costs": "Applies costs when patients transition from postoperative VBT state to index fusion procedure. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact for the specific transition.",
    
    "Fusion Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients transition from any postoperative fusion state to a fusion revision state. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact for transitions to revision states.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values based on the health state patients occupy. Applies postop_vbt_utility for patients in postoperative VBT states, postop_fusion_utility for patients in any postoperative fusion states. Utility values are multiplied by cycle length to calculate QALYs. This is an occupancy impact.",
    
    "Background Mortality": "Applies age-dependent mortality across all health states. Uses background_mortality_base and increases it by mortality_age_multiplier each year as patients age. This creates transitions to a death state from all health states.",
    
    "Procedure-Related Disutility": "Applies temporary disutility during cycles when patients undergo procedures (index or revision). This would be a flow impact when patients transition into procedure states, representing the temporary reduction in quality of life during recovery periods."
}
</event_recommendations>

Based on the model description, I've identified these key events that would capture the costs and utilities in the model. The events follow the principles of good event design by:

1. Separating distinct mechanisms (procedure costs vs. health state utilities)
2. Avoiding duplication of event-rate logic
3. Using flow impacts for transition-dependent costs
4. Using occupancy impacts for health state utilities
5. Not attempting to define transition probabilities within events

Note that we may need to add more parameters or refine these events as the model development progresses, particularly for aspects like procedure-related disutility which might need additional parameters to quantify the temporary impact of procedures on quality of life.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code. You should not add parameters that are simply conversions of other parameters, as these are not true independent parameters. Instead perform the conversion calculation in your code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I've read through the event mechanics and the guidance on adding additional parameters. I understand that for each event, we'll first conceptualize it precisely and then implement it in code. I'll use the provided helper functions to initialize impacts and add cost and QALY impacts for both occupancy and flow.

If I need additional parameters beyond what's provided in the available parameters list, I'll specify them in a JSON array within <additional_parameters> tags during the conceptualization step. I'll only add truly independent parameters, not derived ones that can be calculated from existing parameters.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first event. Please provide the event you'd like me to work on first.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these. Please note you will have access to the time horizon (in years) and cycle length (in years) as further variables.

# Conceptual Plan for "Index Procedure Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model. These costs should be applied as a one-time flow impact when patients transition from their respective index procedure states to the post-operative states.

## Health States Analysis
Based on the provided health states, I can see:
- `VBT_Index`: The initial state for patients receiving VBT
- `PostVBT__tunnel_0`: The first post-operative state after VBT
- `Fusion_Index`: The initial state for patients receiving spinal fusion
- `PostFusion_Index__tunnel_0`: The first post-operative state after fusion

## Cost Calculation Logic
1. For the VBT arm:
   - Apply a cost when patients transition from `VBT_Index` to `PostVBT__tunnel_0`
   - Cost = VBT index device cost + non-device cost = $50,615 + $28,616 = $79,231

2. For the fusion arm:
   - Apply a cost when patients transition from `Fusion_Index` to `PostFusion_Index__tunnel_0`
   - Cost = Fusion device cost + non-device cost = $17,200 + $28,616 = $45,816

## Implementation Approach
- I will use flow impacts to apply these costs during the specific transitions
- The costs will be calculated by adding the device costs and non-device costs from the parameters
- No additional parameters are needed as all required costs are already provided

## Assumptions
- The index procedure costs are applied only once at the beginning of the model
- The costs are applied as patients transition from the index procedure state to the first post-operative state
- No additional costs are incurred while patients remain in the index procedure state
- The costs are the same regardless of patient characteristics or other factors

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required cost components are already available in the provided parameters.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Access the cycle number by using context.cycle
- Access the treatment name by using context.treatment
- Access the model health states using context.health_states
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use context.cycle_length_years, and context.time_horizon_years if you need to access these variable values
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT Revision Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply costs when patients transition from postoperative VBT states to the VBT revision state. These costs include the VBT revision device cost plus non-device costs and will be implemented as a flow impact for the specific transitions.

## Health States Analysis
Based on the provided health states, I can see:
- `PostVBT__tunnel_0`: The first post-operative state after VBT (tunnel state for first quarter)
- `PostVBT__long_term`: The long-term post-operative state after VBT
- `VBT_Revision`: The state representing VBT revision procedure

## Cost Calculation Logic
1. Calculate the total cost for VBT revision:
   - VBT revision total cost = VBT revision device cost + non-device cost
   - = $8,804 + $28,616 = $37,420

2. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition:
   - From `PostVBT__tunnel_0` to `VBT_Revision`
   - From `PostVBT__long_term` to `VBT_Revision`

## Implementation Approach
- I will use flow impacts to apply these costs during the specific transitions
- The costs will be calculated by adding the VBT revision device cost and non-device cost from the parameters
- No additional parameters are needed as all required costs are already provided

## Assumptions
- The VBT revision costs are applied only when patients transition to the VBT revision state
- The same revision cost applies regardless of whether the patient is coming from the tunnel state or the long-term state
- The costs are applied as a one-time flow impact during the transition
- After revision, patients will transition to some post-revision state (not explicitly modeled in this event)
- The non-device costs are the same for revision procedures as they are for index procedures

I notice that there is no explicit post-VBT revision state in the health states list. Based on the model description, I assume that after VBT revision, patients would either return to a post-VBT state or potentially move to a fusion procedure. However, since this event only deals with the costs of the VBT revision itself, I don't need to model those subsequent transitions here.

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required cost components are already available in the provided parameters.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Access the cycle number by using context.cycle
- Access the treatment name by using context.treatment
- Access the model health states using context.health_states
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use context.cycle_length_years, and context.time_horizon_years if you need to access these variable values
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

- `VBT_Revision`: The state representing VBT revision procedure

## Cost Calculation Logic
1. Calculate the total cost for index fusion after VBT:
   - Index fusion total cost = Fusion device cost + non-device cost
   - = $17,200 + $28,616 = $45,816

2. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition:
   - From `PostVBT__tunnel_0` to `Fusion_Index`
   - From `PostVBT__long_term` to `Fusion_Index`
   - From `VBT_Revision` to `Fusion_Index` (as patients may need fusion after a failed VBT revision)

## Implementation Approach
- I will use flow impacts to apply these costs during the specific transitions
- The costs will be calculated by adding the fusion device cost and non-device cost from the parameters
- No additional parameters are needed as all required costs are already provided

## Assumptions
- The index fusion costs are applied only when patients transition to the fusion index state from a VBT-related state
- The same fusion cost applies regardless of which VBT-related state the patient is coming from
- The costs are applied as a one-time flow impact during the transition
- The non-device costs are the same for fusion procedures after VBT as they are for primary fusion procedures
- Patients who have had a VBT revision may still need to transition to fusion, so we include that transition

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required cost components are already available in the provided parameters.

# Conceptual Plan for "Fusion Revision Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply costs when patients transition from any postoperative fusion state to a fusion revision state. These costs include the fusion device cost plus non-device costs and will be implemented as a flow impact for the specific transitions to revision states.

## Health States Analysis
Based on the provided health states, I can identify the following relevant states:

**Postoperative fusion states:**
- `PostFusion_Index__tunnel_0`: First quarter after index fusion
- `PostFusion_Index__long_term`: Long-term state after index fusion
- `PostFusion_Revision_1__tunnel_0`: First quarter after first fusion revision
- `PostFusion_Revision_1__long_term`: Long-term state after first fusion revision

**Fusion revision states:**
- `Fusion_Revision_1`: First fusion revision procedure
- `Fusion_Revision_2`: Second fusion revision procedure
- `Ineligible_Fusion`: State for patients who need a third revision (absorbing state)

## Cost Calculation Logic
1. Calculate the total cost for fusion revision:
   - Fusion revision total cost = Fusion device cost + non-device cost
   - = $17,200 + $28,616 = $45,816

2. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition:
   - From `PostFusion_Index__tunnel_0` to `Fusion_Revision_1`
   - From `PostFusion_Index__long_term` to `Fusion_Revision_1`
   - From `PostFusion_Revision_1__tunnel_0` to `Fusion_Revision_2`
   - From `PostFusion_Revision_1__long_term` to `Fusion_Revision_2`
   - From `PostFusion_Revision_2__tunnel_0` to `Ineligible_Fusion`
   - From `PostFusion_Revision_2__long_term` to `Ineligible_Fusion`

## Implementation Approach
- I will use flow impacts to apply these costs during the specific transitions
- The costs will be calculated by adding the fusion device cost and non-device cost from the parameters
- I'll assume the same device and non-device costs apply for all fusion revisions

## Assumptions
- The fusion revision costs are applied only when patients transition to a fusion revision state
- The same fusion device and non-device costs apply for all fusion revisions (first, second, and subsequent)
- The costs are applied as a one-time flow impact during the transition
- Transitions to the `Ineligible_Fusion` state also incur the fusion revision costs, as this represents a third revision that is performed but after which no further revisions are possible
- No additional costs are incurred while patients remain in the revision procedure states

No additional parameters are needed for this event as all required cost components are already available in the provided parameters.

User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Access the cycle number by using context.cycle
- Access the treatment name by using context.treatment
- Access the model health states using context.health_states
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use context.cycle_length_years, and context.time_horizon_years if you need to access these variable values
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

User:
Brilliant. Now we are going to generate some helpful metadata for the event. 

Requirements:
- Always include the metadata within <metadata></metadata> tags.
- Include only a JSON within the <metadata> tags
- the JSON should have the fields:
    - 'description': a brief description of the real-world mechanism/trigger the Event represents, and the cost and/or QALY impact associated with the event (including what under conditions/rate this is applied)
    - 'assumptions': Any important calculation assumptions made in the Event
