User:
We are going to work together to produce a transition matrix generation function for a cohort Markov model. The generation function (written using Python) calculates the transition probabilities for for all health states for a given cycle and treatment arm. Guidance on building the generation function is provided below (see <guidance_on_building_transition_matrix_generation_function></guidance_on_building_transition_matrix_generation_function>). 

<guidance_on_building_transition_matrix_generation_function>
- You should name the transition matrix generation function get_transition_matrix
- The transition matrix generation function must have the signature:
    def get_transition_matrix(context: TransitionMatrixContext) -> np.ndarray
- To ensure you return an array, you should use transition_matrix.as_array() where transition_matrix is your NamedTransitionMatrix
- Within the transition matrix generation function, use the provided TransitionContext fields:
    - context.health_states (list (string) of all states in model)
    - context.cycle (int)
    - context.treatment (string)
    - context.params (dict of parameters, see <available_parameters></available_parameters> below)
- Do NOT hard-code parameter values, always use the parameters from the context.params dictionary
- Use this helper to initialise the transition matrix
    transition_matrix = NamedTransitionMatrix(context.health_states)
- Set explicit probabilities using:
    transition_matrix.set("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DESTINATION_STATE>", <probability_expression>)
- Ensure the transition_matrix represents probabilities (not rates). If you are given rates, convert using:
    p = 1 - exp(-rate * cycle_length_years)
  (cycle_length_years should come from params if needed).
-  You do not need to define NamedTransitionMatrix, or TransitionMatrixContext. These have already been defined

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs

Once you have understood all these instructions, and the model we are building, please acknowledge this. Then, I will follow up with the instructions for building the transition matrix generation function. 


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the instructions and the model we are building. This is a Markov cohort model for comparing VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) versus spinal fusion for pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis.

The model has 10 health states:
1. Spinal Fusion Index Procedure
2. VBT Index Procedure
3. Postoperative VBT
4. Postoperative Fusion
5. VBT Revision
6. Fusion Revision 1
7. Postoperative Fusion Revision 1
8. Fusion Revision 2
9. Postoperative Fusion Revision 2
10. Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision

The model has a 15-year time horizon with 3-month cycles, and I'll need to create a transition matrix generation function that calculates transition probabilities between these states for each cycle and treatment arm.

I'm ready to build the transition matrix generation function according to the provided guidance.
