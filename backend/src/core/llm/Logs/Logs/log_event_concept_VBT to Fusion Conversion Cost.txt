User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index VBT Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the initial VBT procedure when patients enter the VBT Index Procedure state. Includes both device costs (vbt_index_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Index Fusion Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the initial spinal fusion procedure when patients enter the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state. Includes both device costs (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of VBT revision when patients transition to the VBT Revision state. Includes both device costs (vbt_revision_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Fusion Revision 1 Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the first fusion revision when patients transition to the Fusion Revision 1 state. Includes both device costs (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Fusion Revision 2 Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the second fusion revision when patients transition to the Fusion Revision 2 state. Includes both device costs (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "VBT to Fusion Conversion Cost": "Applies the cost when VBT patients require conversion to fusion (transitioning from Postoperative VBT to Spinal Fusion Index Procedure). Includes both device costs (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values for each health state per cycle, adjusted for cycle length. Uses postop_vbt_utility for Postoperative VBT state, postop_fusion_utility for all postoperative fusion states, and preop_utility for procedure states.",

    "Recovery Period Utility": "Captures any differences in utility during the immediate recovery period after procedures. This could be implemented as a cycle-dependent utility adjustment for the first few cycles after a procedure.",
    
    "Long-term Health State Costs": "Captures any ongoing healthcare costs associated with each health state (beyond the procedure costs). This would include routine follow-up visits, pain management, etc. that may differ between VBT and fusion patients."
}
</event_recommendations>

These events cover the key cost and utility impacts in the model while avoiding double counting. Each event represents a distinct mechanism for accruing costs or utilities. The procedure costs are implemented as flow impacts when patients transition into procedure states, while health state utilities are implemented as occupancy impacts based on which state patients occupy during each cycle.

Note that some of these events (particularly the "Procedure Disutility", "Recovery Period Utility", and "Long-term Health State Costs") may require additional parameters not currently specified in the available parameters list. These could be added if needed based on available data.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code

I've read through the Event mechanics and understand how to:
- Create calculation functions that return EventImpact objects
- Use initialise_impact() to create the impact object
- Add occupancy impacts for costs and QALYs
- Add flow impacts for costs and QALYs

I also understand that I can add additional parameters if needed by providing them in a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Conceptual Plan for "Index VBT Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of the initial VBT procedure when patients enter the VBT Index Procedure state. According to the model description, index procedure costs should be applied upon entry to the model.

## Calculation Approach
- The cost will be applied as a flow impact when patients transition from any state to the "VBT Index Procedure" state
- Since patients start in the index procedure state according to the initial occupancy, we need to handle the initial cycle differently
- The total cost will be the sum of:
  - VBT device cost (`vbt_index_device_cost` = $50,615)
  - Non-device cost (`non_device_cost` = $28,616)
  - Total cost = $79,231 per patient

## Implementation Details
1. For the initial cycle (cycle 0):
   - Apply the cost as an occupancy impact for patients in the "VBT Index Procedure" state
   - This handles patients who start in this state

2. For subsequent cycles:
   - Apply the cost as a flow impact for any transitions into the "VBT Index Procedure" state
   - This handles patients who might enter this state later (though in this model structure, this is unlikely to happen)

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_index_device_cost`: $50,615 (Index VBT device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

## Assumptions
- The cost is incurred once when a patient enters the VBT Index Procedure state
- No additional costs are incurred while staying in this state beyond the initial entry
- We need to handle the initial cycle differently since patients start in the index procedure state

User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

# Conceptual Plan for "Index Fusion Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of the initial spinal fusion procedure when patients enter the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state. Similar to the VBT index procedure, these costs should be applied upon entry to the model.

## Calculation Approach
- The cost will be applied as a flow impact when patients transition from any state to the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state
- Since patients in the Fusion arm start in the index procedure state according to the initial occupancy, we need to handle the initial cycle differently
- The total cost will be the sum of:
  - Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost` = $17,200)
  - Non-device cost (`non_device_cost` = $28,616)
  - Total cost = $45,816 per patient

## Implementation Details
1. For the initial cycle (cycle 0):
   - Apply the cost as an occupancy impact for patients in the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state
   - This handles patients who start in this state (those in the Fusion arm)

2. For subsequent cycles:
   - Apply the cost as a flow impact for any transitions into the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state
   - This handles patients who might enter this state later (particularly VBT patients who later require fusion)

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (Fusion device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)
- `apply_initial_costs`: 1 (Flag to apply initial procedure costs in cycle 0)

## Assumptions
- The cost is incurred once when a patient enters the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state
- No additional costs are incurred while staying in this state beyond the initial entry
- Patients in the Fusion arm start in the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state and incur this cost immediately
- VBT patients who later require fusion will incur this cost when they transition to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state

No additional parameters are needed for this event as we can use the existing parameters, including the `apply_initial_costs` parameter that was added for the previous event.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT Revision Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of VBT revision when patients transition to the "VBT Revision" state. Unlike the index procedures, patients do not start in this state but transition to it from the "Postoperative VBT" state when a revision is required.

## Calculation Approach
- The cost will be applied as a flow impact when patients transition from any state (primarily "Postoperative VBT") to the "VBT Revision" state
- The total cost will be the sum of:
  - VBT revision device cost (`vbt_revision_device_cost` = $8,804)
  - Non-device cost (`non_device_cost` = $28,616)
  - Total cost = $37,420 per patient

## Implementation Details
- Apply the cost as a flow impact for any transitions into the "VBT Revision" state
- Unlike the index procedures, we don't need special handling for cycle 0 since no patients start in the VBT Revision state
- According to the model description, patients in the "Postoperative VBT" state can experience VBT revision, which would trigger this cost

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_revision_device_cost`: $8,804 (VBT revision device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

## Assumptions
- The cost is incurred once when a patient enters the VBT Revision state
- No additional costs are incurred while staying in this state beyond the initial entry
- Patients can only enter the VBT Revision state from the Postoperative VBT state (though our implementation will handle any transition to this state)
- No patients start in the VBT Revision state at cycle 0

No additional parameters are needed for this event as we can use the existing parameters.

<current_event_name>
Fusion Revision 1 Procedure Cost
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Applies the cost of the first fusion revision when patients transition to the Fusion Revision 1 state. Includes both device costs (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).
</current_event_description>

Context:
<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

# Conceptual Plan for "Fusion Revision 1 Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of the first fusion revision when patients transition to the "Fusion Revision 1" state. According to the model description, patients in the "Postoperative Fusion" state may require revision and transition to this state.

## Calculation Approach
- The cost will be applied as a flow impact when patients transition from any state (primarily "Postoperative Fusion") to the "Fusion Revision 1" state
- The total cost will be the sum of:
  - Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost` = $17,200)
  - Non-device cost (`non_device_cost` = $28,616)
  - Total cost = $45,816 per patient

## Implementation Details
- Apply the cost as a flow impact for any transitions into the "Fusion Revision 1" state
- No special handling is needed for cycle 0 since no patients start in the Fusion Revision 1 state
- According to the model description, patients in the "Postoperative Fusion" state can experience fusion revision, which would trigger this cost

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (Fusion device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

## Assumptions
- The cost is incurred once when a patient enters the Fusion Revision 1 state
- No additional costs are incurred while staying in this state beyond the initial entry
- Patients can only enter the Fusion Revision 1 state from the Postoperative Fusion state (though our implementation will handle any transition to this state)
- No patients start in the Fusion Revision 1 state at cycle 0
- The device cost for fusion revision is the same as for the index fusion procedure (using `fusion_device_cost`)

No additional parameters are needed for this event as we can use the existing parameters.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state.

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT to Fusion Conversion Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost when VBT patients require conversion to fusion, specifically when they transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state. According to the model description, patients in the postoperative VBT state can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure.

## Calculation Approach
- The cost will be applied as a flow impact specifically for the transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure"
- The total cost will be the sum of:
  - Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost` = $17,200)
  - Non-device cost (`non_device_cost` = $28,616)
  - Total cost = $45,816 per patient

## Implementation Details
- Apply the cost as a flow impact specifically for the transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure"
- Unlike the previous events that applied costs for any transition into a procedure state, this event is more specific to avoid double counting
- This is because the "Index Fusion Procedure Cost" event already handles general transitions into the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (Fusion device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

## Assumptions
- The cost is incurred once when a patient transitions from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure"
- The cost structure for conversion to fusion is the same as for an initial fusion procedure
- We need to be careful to avoid double counting with the "Index Fusion Procedure Cost" event
- There are no additional costs specific to the conversion process beyond the standard fusion procedure costs

## Potential Issue and Solution
There's a potential for double counting if both this event and the "Index Fusion Procedure Cost" event apply costs to the same transition. To avoid this:

1. This event will specifically target only the transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure"
2. We'll need to modify the "Index Fusion Procedure Cost" event to exclude this specific transition, or
3. We'll need to add a parameter to control which event handles this transition
