User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model. For VBT arm, applies VBT index device cost plus non-device costs. For fusion arm, applies fusion device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact from the initial state to the index procedure state.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo VBT revision. Includes VBT revision device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state.",
    
    "Fusion Procedure Costs After VBT": "Applies costs when VBT patients later undergo fusion. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact from Postoperative VBT to Postoperative Fusion state.",
    
    "First Fusion Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo their first fusion revision. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact to the Fusion Revision 1 state.",
    
    "Second Fusion Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo their second fusion revision. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. This is a flow impact to the Fusion Revision 2 state.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values based on patients' current health states. Applies postop_vbt_utility for Postoperative VBT state, postop_fusion_utility for all fusion postoperative states, and preop_utility for procedure states. Utilities are multiplied by cycle length to convert to QALYs. This is an occupancy impact.",
    
    "Procedure Disutility": "Applies temporary disutility during cycles when patients are undergoing procedures (index or revision). This reflects the temporary reduction in quality of life during the procedure and immediate recovery period. This is an occupancy impact for procedure states."
}
</event_recommendations>

Based on the model description and parameters, these events capture the key economic impacts. The events separate procedure costs (which occur as flow impacts when patients transition to procedure states) from ongoing health state utilities (which occur as occupancy impacts while patients remain in states). 

I've kept the events at an appropriate level of granularity - separating different procedure costs since they have different values, but combining all health state utilities into a single event since they follow the same pattern of application. The procedure disutility event allows for temporary quality of life impacts during procedures.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code. You should not add parameters that are simply conversions of other parameters, as these are not true independent parameters. Instead perform the conversion calculation in your code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I've read through the event mechanics and the guidance on adding additional parameters. I understand that for each event, we'll first conceptualize it precisely and then implement it in code. 

I see that each event consists of a calculation function that takes an EventContext and returns an EventImpact, along with an EventSpec that references the function. I'll use the helper functions provided to initialize impacts and add cost and QALY impacts for both occupancy and flow.

If I need additional parameters that aren't already provided in the model, I'll add them during the conceptualization phase using the specified JSON format within <additional_parameters> tags.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first event.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Conceptual Plan for "Index Procedure Costs" Event

This event applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model and transition from the index procedure states to their respective postoperative states.

## Key Calculations:
1. For VBT arm:
   - Apply the cost when patients transition from "VBT Index Procedure" to "Postoperative VBT"
   - Total cost = VBT index device cost + non-device cost
   - Parameters needed: `vbt_index_device_cost` and `non_device_cost`

2. For Fusion arm:
   - Apply the cost when patients transition from "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" to "Postoperative Fusion"
   - Total cost = Fusion device cost + non-device cost
   - Parameters needed: `fusion_device_cost` and `non_device_cost`

## Implementation Approach:
- This will be implemented as a flow impact (costs applied during transitions)
- The costs will be applied to the transitions from index procedure states to postoperative states
- No QALY impacts are included in this event (those will be handled by a separate utility event)

## Parameters to Use:
- `vbt_index_device_cost`: $50,615 (Index VBT device cost)
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (Fusion device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

## Assumptions:
- The costs are applied as a one-time cost during the transition from index procedure to postoperative state
- The costs are the same regardless of patient characteristics
- No additional parameters are needed for this event

All required parameters are already available in the model, so no additional parameters need to be defined.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:

Event description (from recommendations):

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model.

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT Revision Procedure Costs" Event

This event applies the costs associated with VBT revision procedures when patients transition from the postoperative VBT state to the VBT revision state.

## Key Calculations:
1. Calculate the total cost of a VBT revision procedure:
   - VBT revision device cost + non-device cost
   - Parameters needed: `vbt_revision_device_cost` and `non_device_cost`

2. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition from:
   - "Postoperative VBT" state to "VBT Revision" state

3. After reviewing the model health states, I notice we need to consider what happens after a VBT revision. Based on the model description, patients would likely return to the "Postoperative VBT" state after a revision. However, I don't see a direct flow from "VBT Revision" back to "Postoperative VBT" explicitly mentioned in the model description.

## Implementation Approach:
- This will be implemented as a flow impact (costs applied during transitions)
- The costs will be applied to the transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision"
- No QALY impacts are included in this event (those will be handled by a separate utility event)

## Parameters to Use:
- `vbt_revision_device_cost`: $8,804 (VBT revision device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

## Assumptions:
- The costs are applied as a one-time cost during the transition from postoperative VBT to VBT revision
- The costs are the same regardless of patient characteristics
- No additional parameters are needed for this event

All required parameters are already available in the model, so no additional parameters need to be defined.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:

    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model.

# Conceptual Plan for "First Fusion Revision Costs" Event

This event applies the costs associated with the first fusion revision procedure when patients transition from the postoperative fusion state to the fusion revision 1 state.

## Key Calculations:
1. Calculate the total cost of a first fusion revision procedure:
   - Fusion device cost + non-device cost
   - Parameters needed: `fusion_device_cost` and `non_device_cost`

2. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition from:
   - "Postoperative Fusion" state to "Fusion Revision 1" state

## Implementation Approach:
- This will be implemented as a flow impact (costs applied during transitions)
- The costs will be applied to the transition from "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1"
- No QALY impacts are included in this event (those will be handled by a separate utility event)

## Parameters to Use:
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (Fusion device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

## Assumptions:
- The costs are applied as a one-time cost during the transition from postoperative fusion to fusion revision 1
- The costs for fusion revision are the same as for the initial fusion procedure (same device and non-device costs)
- The costs are the same regardless of whether the patient originally had VBT or fusion as their index procedure
- No additional parameters are needed for this event

All required parameters are already available in the model, so no additional parameters need to be defined.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

# Conceptual Plan for "Health State Utilities" Event

This event applies appropriate utility values to each health state in the model, converting them to QALYs by multiplying by the cycle length.

## Key Calculations:
1. Apply utility values to each health state:
   - Postoperative VBT state: `postop_vbt_utility`
   - Postoperative fusion states (Postoperative Fusion, Postoperative Fusion Revision 1, Postoperative Fusion Revision 2): `postop_fusion_utility`
   - Procedure states (VBT Index Procedure, Spinal Fusion Index Procedure, VBT Revision, Fusion Revision 1, Fusion Revision 2): `preop_utility`
   - Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision state: `postop_fusion_utility` (assuming same utility as other postoperative fusion states)

2. Convert utility values to QALYs by multiplying by the cycle length in years:
   - Cycle length is given in months (`cycle_length`), so we need to convert to years by dividing by 12

## Implementation Approach:
- This will be implemented as an occupancy impact (utilities applied while in each state)
- For each health state, apply the appropriate utility value multiplied by the cycle length in years
- Group states by the utility value they receive

## Parameters to Use:
- `postop_vbt_utility`: 0.925 (Postoperative VBT utility)
- `postop_fusion_utility`: 0.875 (Postoperative spinal fusion utility)
- `preop_utility`: 0.783 (Preoperative VBT and spinal fusion utility)
- `cycle_length`: 3 (Model cycle length in months)

## Assumptions:
- The "Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision" state has the same utility as other postoperative fusion states
- Utilities are constant over time within each health state
- The cycle length needs to be converted from months to years (divide by 12) to calculate QALYs correctly
- No additional parameters are needed for this event

All required parameters are already available in the model, so no additional parameters need to be defined.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.


Target Event:
<current_event_name>
Procedure Disutility
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Applies temporary disutility during cycles when patients are undergoing procedures (index or revision). This reflects the temporary reduction in quality of life during the procedure and immediate recovery period. This is an occupancy impact for procedure states.
</current_event_description>

Context:
<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

# Conceptual Plan for "Procedure Disutility" Event

This event applies temporary disutility during cycles when patients are undergoing procedures (index or revision), reflecting the temporary reduction in quality of life during the procedure and immediate recovery period.

## Key Calculations:
1. Identify procedure states where disutility should be applied:
   - VBT Index Procedure
   - Spinal Fusion Index Procedure
   - VBT Revision
   - Fusion Revision 1
   - Fusion Revision 2

2. Apply procedure-specific disutilities to each procedure state:
   - We need to define disutility values for VBT procedures and fusion procedures
   - These disutilities will be applied as negative QALY impacts (reducing the overall utility)
   - The disutilities need to be multiplied by the cycle length in years

## Implementation Approach:
- This will be implemented as an occupancy impact (disutilities applied while in procedure states)
- For each procedure state, apply the appropriate disutility value multiplied by the cycle length in years
- Group states by the type of procedure (VBT vs. fusion) if they have different disutility values

## Parameters to Use:
- `cycle_length`: 3 (Model cycle length in months)

## Missing Parameters:
- We need to define disutility values for VBT and fusion procedures
- These parameters are not currently available in the model

## Assumptions:
- The disutility is applied as a negative QALY impact
- VBT procedures may have a different disutility than fusion procedures due to differences in invasiveness
- The disutility is applied for the entire cycle when patients are in procedure states
- The cycle length needs to be converted from months to years (divide by 12) to calculate QALYs correctly
