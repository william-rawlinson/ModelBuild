User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

First, let me identify the health states that will be needed based on the model description:
1. VBT Index Procedure
2. Postoperative VBT
3. VBT Revision
4. Fusion Index Procedure
5. Postoperative Fusion Index
6. Fusion Revision 1
7. Postoperative Fusion Revision 1
8. Fusion Revision 2
9. Postoperative Fusion Revision 2
10. Ineligible Fusion (absorbing state)

Now I'll create appropriate Events for this model:

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the one-time costs associated with the initial VBT or fusion procedure when patients enter the model. Uses vbt_index_device_cost + non_device_cost for VBT arm and fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost for fusion arm. This is a flow impact from the initial state to the respective index procedure state.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies the costs associated with VBT revision procedures. Uses vbt_revision_device_cost + non_device_cost. This is a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision.",
    
    "Fusion After VBT Costs": "Applies the costs associated with fusion procedures for patients who previously had VBT. Uses fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost. This is a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Fusion Index Procedure.",
    
    "Fusion Revision 1 Costs": "Applies the costs associated with the first fusion revision. Uses fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost. This is a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative Fusion Index to Fusion Revision 1.",
    
    "Fusion Revision 2 Costs": "Applies the costs associated with the second fusion revision. Uses fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost. This is a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative Fusion Revision 1 to Fusion Revision 2.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies the appropriate utility values for each health state, adjusted by cycle length. Uses postop_vbt_utility for Postoperative VBT state, postop_fusion_utility for all postoperative fusion states (Postoperative Fusion Index, Postoperative Fusion Revision 1, Postoperative Fusion Revision 2), and preop_utility for procedure states (as these represent the time during which procedures are performed). This is an occupancy impact for all health states.",
    
    "Procedure Disutility": "Captures any temporary reduction in quality of life during procedure cycles. This would be an occupancy impact for the procedure states (VBT Index Procedure, VBT Revision, Fusion Index Procedure, Fusion Revision 1, Fusion Revision 2). The exact disutility values would need to be added to the parameters if not already included in the health state utilities.",
    
    "Recovery Period Costs": "Captures any additional healthcare costs during recovery periods after procedures. This would be an occupancy impact for the postoperative states. The exact recovery costs would need to be added to the parameters if not already included."
}
</event_recommendations>

These events cover the main cost and utility impacts described in the model. The events are organized around distinct real-world mechanisms (procedures, health state occupancy) rather than being overly granular. Each event captures either costs or utilities associated with specific transitions or health state occupancy, avoiding double counting.

If additional parameters become available (such as outpatient follow-up costs, medication costs, or procedure-specific disutilities), we could expand this set of events accordingly.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code

I've read through the Event mechanics and understand how to:
- Create calculation functions that return EventImpact objects
- Use the helper functions to initialize impacts and add cost/QALY impacts for both occupancy and flow
- Define EventSpec objects that reference the calculation functions

I also understand that I can add additional parameters if needed by providing them in a JSON array within <additional_parameters> tags during the conceptualization phase.

I'm ready to proceed with implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Conceptual Plan for "Index Procedure Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the one-time costs associated with the initial VBT or fusion procedure when patients enter the model. These costs should be applied as flow impacts when patients transition from their initial state to the respective postoperative state.

## Health States Involved
Based on the provided health states, this event will involve:
- From: 'VBT Index Procedure' → To: 'Postoperative VBT'
- From: 'Spinal Fusion Index Procedure' → To: 'Postoperative Fusion'

## Cost Calculations
1. For VBT index procedure:
   - Total cost = vbt_index_device_cost + non_device_cost
   - = $50,615 + $28,616 = $79,231

2. For spinal fusion index procedure:
   - Total cost = fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost
   - = $17,200 + $28,616 = $45,816

## Implementation Approach
- The event will check the treatment arm to determine which costs to apply
- For the VBT arm, apply the VBT index procedure cost as a flow impact from 'VBT Index Procedure' to 'Postoperative VBT'
- For the fusion arm, apply the fusion index procedure cost as a flow impact from 'Spinal Fusion Index Procedure' to 'Postoperative Fusion'

## Parameters Used
- vbt_index_device_cost: $50,615
- fusion_device_cost: $17,200
- non_device_cost: $28,616

## Assumptions
- The costs are applied only once when patients transition from the index procedure state to the postoperative state
- All patients in each arm will incur these costs (100% transition probability from index procedure to postoperative state)
- The costs are applied in full during the transition, with no spreading across multiple cycles

I don't need any additional parameters for this event as all required cost components are already available in the provided parameters.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec


================================================================================
Assistant:
Let me implement the Index Procedure Costs Event as conceptualized:

<final_code>
def get_index_procedure_costs_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:

    when patients enter the model.
    """
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    
    # Calculate VBT index procedure cost
    vbt_index_cost = float(context.params["vbt_index_device_cost"]) + float(context.params["non_device_cost"])
    
    # Calculate fusion index procedure cost
    fusion_index_cost = float(context.params["fusion_device_cost"]) + float(context.params["non_device_cost"])
    
    # Apply costs as flow impacts from index procedure states to postoperative states
    impact.cost_flow.add("VBT Index Procedure", "Postoperative VBT", vbt_index_cost)
    impact.cost_flow.add("Spinal Fusion Index Procedure", "Postoperative Fusion", fusion_index_cost)
    
    return impact

index_procedure_costs_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Index Procedure Costs",
    tags={"cost", "procedure"},
    calculation_function=get_index_procedure_costs_impact,
)
</final_code>

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state.

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT Revision Procedure Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the costs associated with VBT revision procedures. These costs should be applied as flow impacts when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state.

## Health States Involved
Based on the provided health states, this event will involve:
- From: 'Postoperative VBT' → To: 'VBT Revision'

## Cost Calculations
For VBT revision procedure:
- Total cost = vbt_revision_device_cost + non_device_cost
- = $8,804 + $28,616 = $37,420

## Implementation Approach
- Apply the VBT revision procedure cost as a flow impact from 'Postoperative VBT' to 'VBT Revision'
- This cost is incurred only when a patient transitions from the postoperative VBT state to the VBT revision state

## Parameters Used
- vbt_revision_device_cost: $8,804
- non_device_cost: $28,616

## Assumptions
- The costs are applied only once when patients transition from the postoperative VBT state to the VBT revision state
- All patients who undergo this transition will incur these costs
- The costs are applied in full during the transition, with no spreading across multiple cycles
- After VBT revision, patients would likely return to a postoperative state, but the model description doesn't explicitly mention where patients go after VBT revision. Based on the health states provided, I'm assuming there's no separate "Postoperative VBT Revision" state, and patients might return to the "Postoperative VBT" state. However, this transition is not relevant for this specific event as we're only concerned with the costs incurred during the transition to VBT Revision.

I don't need any additional parameters for this event as all required cost components are already available in the provided parameters.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Target Event:
<current_event_name>
Fusion After VBT Costs
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Applies the costs associated with fusion procedures for patients who previously had VBT. Uses fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost. This is a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Fusion Index Procedure.
</current_event_description>

Context:
<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state.

- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs

# Conceptual Plan for "Fusion Revision 2 Costs" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the costs associated with the second fusion revision procedure. These costs should be applied as flow impacts when patients transition from the Postoperative Fusion Revision 1 state to the Fusion Revision 2 state.

## Health States Involved
Based on the provided health states, this event will involve:
- From: 'Postoperative Fusion Revision 1' → To: 'Fusion Revision 2'

## Cost Calculations
For the second fusion revision procedure:
- Total cost = fusion_device_cost + non_device_cost
- = $17,200 + $28,616 = $45,816

## Implementation Approach
- Apply the fusion revision procedure cost as a flow impact from 'Postoperative Fusion Revision 1' to 'Fusion Revision 2'
- This cost is incurred only when a patient transitions from the postoperative fusion revision 1 state to the fusion revision 2 state
- The event should check the fusion_revision_2 flag to ensure this cost is only applied if second revisions are included in the model

## Parameters Used
- fusion_device_cost: $17,200
- non_device_cost: $28,616
- fusion_revision_2: Flag to include Fusion Revision 2 state in the model (1 = include, 0 = exclude)

## Assumptions
- The costs are applied only once when patients transition from the postoperative fusion revision 1 state to the fusion revision 2 state
- All patients who undergo this transition will incur these costs
- The costs are applied in full during the transition, with no spreading across multiple cycles
- After the fusion revision 2 procedure, patients will move to the 'Postoperative Fusion Revision 2' state, but this subsequent transition is not relevant for this specific event
- The cost of a second fusion revision is the same as the cost of an index fusion procedure and first fusion revision (same device and non-device costs)
- If the fusion_revision_2 flag is set to 0, this event should not apply any costs (though in practice, the transition would not occur in the model)

I don't need any additional parameters for this event as all required cost components are already available in the provided parameters.
