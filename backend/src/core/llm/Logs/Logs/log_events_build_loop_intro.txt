User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, calculate transitions, or implement other model mechanics.   Assume all transition probabilities and state occupancies have already been calculated, as they have been elsewhere.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

First, let me identify the health states that should be included in this model based on the description:

1. VBT_Index (initial VBT procedure)
2. Postop_VBT (post-VBT state)
3. VBT_Revision (VBT revision procedure)
4. Fusion_Index (initial fusion procedure)
5. Postop_Fusion_Index (post-initial fusion state)
6. Fusion_Revision_1 (first fusion revision procedure)
7. Postop_Fusion_Revision_1 (post-first fusion revision state)
8. Fusion_Revision_2 (second fusion revision procedure)
9. Postop_Fusion_Revision_2 (post-second fusion revision state)
10. Ineligible_Fusion (absorbing state for patients who would need a third fusion revision)

Now, I'll recommend appropriate Events for this model:

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the one-time costs for the initial procedures (VBT or fusion). Includes both device costs and non-device procedure costs. This is a flow impact from the initial state to the post-operative state.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies the one-time costs for VBT revision procedures. Includes both VBT revision device costs and non-device procedure costs. This is a flow impact when patients transition from Postop_VBT to VBT_Revision.",
    
    "Fusion Procedure Costs After VBT": "Applies the one-time costs when VBT patients require a fusion procedure. Includes both fusion device costs and non-device procedure costs. This is a flow impact when patients transition from Postop_VBT to Fusion_Index.",
    
    "Fusion Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies the one-time costs for fusion revision procedures. Includes both fusion device costs and non-device procedure costs. This is a flow impact when patients transition to any fusion revision state.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies the appropriate utility values for each health state a patient occupies during a cycle. Different utility values are applied for post-VBT states versus post-fusion states. This is an occupancy impact that applies the cycle-adjusted utility for each health state.",
    
    "Procedure Disutility": "Applies temporary disutility during cycles when patients undergo procedures (index or revision). This captures the temporary reduction in quality of life associated with surgical procedures and recovery. This is a flow impact when patients transition to any procedure state."
}
</event_recommendations>

Based on the model description and parameters, these events cover the key economic impacts. The events separate costs by procedure type and timing, while utilities are handled based on health state occupancy. I've included a procedure disutility event to capture the temporary quality of life impact during surgical procedures, though we may need to add a parameter for this if not already available.

The events follow the principle of separating distinct mechanisms, avoiding duplication, and preventing double counting. They focus solely on per-patient cost and QALY impacts without attempting to modify state transitions or implement other model mechanics.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code. You should not add parameters that are simply conversions of other parameters, as these are not true independent parameters. Instead perform the conversion calculation in your code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code

I've read through the event mechanics and understand how to:
- Create calculation functions that return EventImpact objects
- Use the helper functions to initialize impacts and add cost/QALY impacts for both occupancy and flow
- Define EventSpec objects that reference the calculation functions

I also understand that I can add additional parameters if needed, using the specified JSON format within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first Event. Please provide the first Event for us to work on.
