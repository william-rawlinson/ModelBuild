User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the one-time costs for the initial procedures (VBT or spinal fusion) when patients enter the model. This includes both device costs and non-device procedure costs. Implemented as flow impacts from the initial state to the respective post-operative states.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Costs": "Captures the costs associated with VBT revision procedures, including device and non-device costs. Implemented as flow impacts when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state.",
    
    "VBT to Fusion Conversion Costs": "Captures the costs when VBT patients require a subsequent fusion procedure. Includes fusion device costs and non-device procedure costs. Implemented as flow impacts when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Postoperative Fusion.",
    
    "Fusion Revision Procedure Costs": "Captures the costs associated with fusion revision procedures, including device and non-device costs. Implemented as flow impacts when patients transition to any fusion revision state.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies the appropriate utility values for each health state (postop VBT utility, postop fusion utility) multiplied by cycle length to calculate QALYs. Implemented as occupancy impacts for all health states.",
    
    "Procedure-Related Disutility": "Captures temporary utility decrements during procedure and immediate recovery periods. Applied as flow impacts when patients undergo any procedure (index or revision).",
    
    "Routine Follow-up Costs": "Captures the ongoing healthcare costs associated with routine follow-up care in each health state. Implemented as occupancy impacts for all post-operative states.",
    
    "Complication Costs": "Captures the costs associated with managing complications in each health state. Implemented as occupancy impacts with potentially different rates for different health states.",
    
    "Time-Dependent Utility Changes": "Captures potential improvements in utility over time as patients recover from procedures. Implemented as occupancy impacts that may vary based on time since procedure."
}
</event_recommendations>

Based on the model description and parameters provided, I've identified these key events that would capture the economic and health impacts in this scoliosis treatment model. The events cover procedure costs (both index and revisions), health state utilities, and ongoing care costs. 

Some events like "Routine Follow-up Costs" and "Complication Costs" might need additional parameters that weren't explicitly provided in the available parameters list, but they would be important to include in a comprehensive health economic model. The "Time-Dependent Utility Changes" event acknowledges that utility values might not be static throughout a patient's time in a health state.

Each event is designed to avoid double-counting and to clearly separate different mechanisms that drive costs and QALYs in the model.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I've read through the event mechanics and understand how to implement the calculation functions and EventSpec objects. I also understand that I can add additional parameters if needed using the specified format.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing each event one by one. Please provide the first event you'd like me to work on.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Index Procedure Costs Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will capture the one-time costs associated with the initial procedures (VBT or spinal fusion) when patients enter the model. These costs should be applied as flow impacts when patients transition from their initial procedure state to the respective post-operative states.

## Calculation Plan
1. The event will apply costs when patients transition from:
   - "VBT Index Procedure" state to "Postoperative VBT" state
   - "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state to "Postoperative Fusion" state

2. For each transition, the total cost will be the sum of:
   - Device cost (specific to the procedure type)
   - Non-device procedure cost (same for all procedures)

3. Parameters needed:
   - `vbt_index_device_cost`: $50,615 (available)
   - `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (available)
   - `non_device_procedure_cost`: $28,616 (available)

## Implementation Approach
- Initialize an empty impact object
- Add cost flow impacts for the two transitions:
  - From "VBT Index Procedure" to "Postoperative VBT": vbt_index_device_cost + non_device_procedure_cost
  - From "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" to "Postoperative Fusion": fusion_device_cost + non_device_procedure_cost

## Assumptions
- The costs are applied only once when patients transition from the index procedure state to the post-operative state
- All patients in the index procedure states will transition to their respective post-operative states in the first cycle
- The costs are the same regardless of patient characteristics or other factors
- No additional costs are incurred while in the index procedure state itself

All required parameters are available in the provided parameter set, so no additional parameters are needed.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

<current_event_name>
VBT Revision Procedure Costs
</current_event_name>

Event description (from recommendations):
<current_event_description>
Captures the costs associated with VBT revision procedures, including device and non-device costs. Implemented as flow impacts when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state.
</current_event_description>

Context:
<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs

# VBT Revision Procedure Costs Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will capture the costs associated with VBT revision procedures when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state. These costs include both the device costs specific to VBT revision and the non-device procedure costs.

## Calculation Plan
1. The event will apply costs when patients transition from:
   - "Postoperative VBT" state to "VBT Revision" state

2. For this transition, the total cost will be the sum of:
   - VBT revision device cost
   - Non-device procedure cost (same for all procedures)

3. Parameters needed:
   - `vbt_revision_device_cost`: $8,804 (available)
   - `non_device_procedure_cost`: $28,616 (available)

4. After a VBT revision, patients would typically return to a post-operative state. Looking at the health states, there isn't a specific "Postoperative VBT Revision" state. Based on the model structure, I need to determine where patients go after the "VBT Revision" state.

## Implementation Approach
- Initialize an empty impact object
- Add cost flow impact for the transition:
  - From "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision": vbt_revision_device_cost + non_device_procedure_cost

## Assumptions
- The costs are applied only once when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state
- The costs are the same regardless of patient characteristics or other factors
- Based on the model health states, it appears that "VBT Revision" is a transient state, and patients would likely transition back to "Postoperative VBT" after revision or potentially to another state
- No additional costs are incurred while in the VBT Revision state itself beyond the transition cost

## Additional Parameter Needed
I need to add one parameter to clarify where patients go after VBT revision:

<additional_parameters>
[
  {
    "parameter_name": "post_vbt_revision_destination",
    "value": "Postoperative VBT",
    "description": "Health state that patients transition to after VBT revision",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "Assuming patients return to Postoperative VBT state after revision. If this is incorrect, the parameter can be updated."
  }
]
</additional_parameters>

User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

# Fusion Revision Procedure Costs Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will capture the costs associated with fusion revision procedures when patients transition to any fusion revision state. These costs include both the device costs for fusion revision and the non-device procedure costs.

## Calculation Plan
1. The event will apply costs when patients transition to fusion revision states:
   - From "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1"
   - From "Postoperative Fusion Revision 1" to "Fusion Revision 2" (this state isn't explicitly listed but is implied in the model description)

2. For each transition, the total cost will be the sum of:
   - Fusion device cost (assuming the same device cost for revisions as for index procedures)
   - Non-device procedure cost (same for all procedures)

3. Parameters needed:
   - `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (available)
   - `non_device_procedure_cost`: $28,616 (available)

## Implementation Approach
- Initialize an empty impact object
- Add cost flow impacts for the transitions to fusion revision states:
  - From "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1": fusion_device_cost + non_device_procedure_cost
  - From "Postoperative Fusion Revision 1" to "Fusion Revision 2": fusion_device_cost + non_device_procedure_cost

## Assumptions and Issues
- I notice there's a discrepancy between the health states listed and the model description:
  - The model description mentions "two further fusion revision health states"
  - The health states list includes "Fusion Revision 1" but not "Fusion Revision 2"
  - Instead, there are "Postoperative Fusion Revision 1" and "Postoperative Fusion Revision 2" states

- Based on the model description and available health states, I'm assuming:
  1. Patients go from "Postoperative Fusion" to "Fusion Revision 1" for their first revision
  2. After "Fusion Revision 1", they go to "Postoperative Fusion Revision 1"
  3. From "Postoperative Fusion Revision 1", they can go to another revision state (which should be "Fusion Revision 2", but this isn't listed)
  4. After that, they would go to "Postoperative Fusion Revision 2"
  5. If another revision is needed after that, they go to "Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision"

## Additional Parameters Needed
I need to add a parameter to represent the missing "Fusion Revision 2" state or clarify the flow between the existing states:

<additional_parameters>

  {
    "parameter_name": "fusion_revision_device_cost",
    "value": 17200.0,
    "description": "Fusion revision device cost (assumed same as index fusion)",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "Assuming revision device costs are the same as index procedure costs for fusion"
  }
]
</additional_parameters>
