User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs
See provided data



Utilities
Health state utilities

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model. For VBT arm, applies VBT index device cost plus non-device costs. For Fusion arm, applies fusion device cost plus non-device costs. These are one-time costs applied as flow impacts when patients transition from the index procedure states.",
    
    "VBT Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo VBT revision. Includes VBT revision device cost plus non-device costs. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state.",
    
    "Fusion Revision Costs": "Applies costs when patients undergo fusion revision procedures. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. Applied as flow impacts when patients transition to Fusion Revision 1 or Fusion Revision 2 states.",
    
    "VBT to Fusion Conversion Costs": "Applies costs when VBT patients later undergo an index fusion procedure. Includes fusion device cost plus non-device costs. Applied as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Postoperative Fusion state.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values based on patients' current health states. Different utility values for postoperative VBT (0.925) and postoperative fusion (0.875) states. Utilities are applied as occupation impacts, adjusted by cycle length to convert to QALYs.",
    
    "Procedure Recovery Disutility": "Captures temporary utility decrements during procedure and immediate recovery periods. Applied as flow impacts when patients transition into any procedure state (index or revision). This accounts for the temporary decrease in quality of life during surgical procedures and recovery.",
    
    "Postoperative Follow-up Costs": "Captures routine follow-up costs in the postoperative periods. Applied as occupation impacts for patients in postoperative states. May vary between VBT and fusion patients based on different monitoring requirements.",
    
    "Long-term Complication Costs": "Captures costs associated with managing long-term complications in each health state. Applied as occupation impacts that may differ between VBT and fusion patients based on different complication profiles.",
    
    "Ineligible State Costs": "Applies costs specific to patients who reach the 'Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision' state. These patients may require alternative management approaches or have higher ongoing care needs. Applied as occupation impacts."
}
</event_recommendations>

These events cover the key cost and utility impacts in the model while following the principles of good event design. Each event represents a distinct real-world mechanism, avoids duplication of logic, and separates occupation impacts (ongoing costs/utilities while in states) from flow impacts (one-time costs/utilities when transitioning between states).

The events account for all the procedures described in the model (index procedures, revisions, and conversions from VBT to fusion) and their associated costs and utility impacts. I've also included events for postoperative follow-up and long-term complications, which are typical considerations in surgical intervention models.
