User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, calculate transitions, or implement other model mechanics.   Assume all transition probabilities and state occupancies have already been calculated, as they have been elsewhere.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs
See provided data



Utilities
Health state utilities
See provided data.

Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

First, let me identify the health states based on the model description:
1. VBT Index Procedure
2. Postoperative VBT
3. Fusion Index Procedure
4. Postoperative Fusion Index
5. First Fusion Revision
6. Postoperative First Fusion Revision
7. Second Fusion Revision
8. Postoperative Second Fusion Revision
9. Ineligible Fusion (absorbing state)
10. Death (absorbing state)

Now, I'll recommend appropriate Events for this model:

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index Procedure Costs": "Applies the initial procedure costs when patients enter the model in either the VBT Index Procedure or Fusion Index Procedure health states. Includes both device costs and non-device procedure costs based on the treatment arm.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies costs when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision. Includes VBT revision device costs and non-device procedure costs.",
    
    "Fusion Index Procedure Costs (after VBT)": "Applies costs when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Fusion Index Procedure. Includes fusion device costs and non-device procedure costs.",
    
    "First Fusion Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies costs when patients transition from Postoperative Fusion Index to First Fusion Revision. Includes fusion device costs and non-device procedure costs.",
    
    "Second Fusion Revision Procedure Costs": "Applies costs when patients transition from Postoperative First Fusion Revision to Second Fusion Revision. Includes fusion device costs and non-device procedure costs.",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values for each health state a patient occupies during a cycle. Uses postop_vbt_utility for Postoperative VBT state and postop_fusion_utility for all postoperative fusion states (Postoperative Fusion Index, Postoperative First Fusion Revision, Postoperative Second Fusion Revision). Multiplies by cycle length to convert to QALYs.",
    
    "Procedure Disutility": "Applies temporary disutility during cycles when patients undergo procedures (index or revision). This would capture the temporary reduction in quality of life associated with surgery and immediate recovery.",
    
    "Background Mortality": "Applies the background mortality rate across all health states, representing the probability of death from causes unrelated to scoliosis or its treatment."
}
</event_recommendations>

These events cover the key cost and utility impacts in the model while avoiding double counting. Each event represents a distinct mechanism that affects costs or QALYs. The events are designed to work with the transition matrix that will handle all the state transitions based on the provided probabilities (vbt_revision_prob, fusion_revision_prob, vbt_to_fusion_prob, etc.).
