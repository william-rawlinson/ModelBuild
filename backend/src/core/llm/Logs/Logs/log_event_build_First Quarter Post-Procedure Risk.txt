User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

<model_description>
Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs
See provided data



Utilities
Health state utilities

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

First, let me identify the health states that will be needed based on the model description:

1. VBT Index Procedure
2. Postoperative VBT
3. VBT Revision Procedure
4. Postoperative VBT Revision
5. Fusion Index Procedure
6. Postoperative Fusion Index
7. Fusion Revision 1 Procedure
8. Postoperative Fusion Revision 1
9. Fusion Revision 2 Procedure
10. Postoperative Fusion Revision 2
11. Ineligible Fusion (absorbing state)

Now, I'll recommend a set of Events for the model:

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values to patients based on their current health state. Includes postoperative VBT utility, postoperative fusion utility, and preoperative utility values. Accounts for cycle length to calculate QALYs.",
    
    "VBT Index Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the initial VBT procedure (device cost + non-device cost) as a flow impact when patients enter the VBT Index Procedure state.",
    
    "Fusion Index Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the initial fusion procedure (fusion device cost + non-device cost) as a flow impact when patients enter the Fusion Index Procedure state, either directly or after transitioning from VBT.",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of VBT revision (VBT revision device cost + non-device cost) as a flow impact when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision Procedure.",
    
    "Fusion Revision Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of fusion revision procedures (fusion device cost + non-device cost) as a flow impact when patients transition to any fusion revision procedure state.",
    
    "VBT to Fusion Transition Cost": "Applies the cost of transitioning from VBT to fusion (fusion device cost + non-device cost) as a flow impact when patients move from Postoperative VBT to Fusion Index Procedure.",
    
    "Procedure-Related Disutility": "Captures any temporary disutility associated with undergoing procedures (if applicable). This would be applied as a flow impact when patients transition into any procedure state.",
    
    "First Quarter Post-Procedure Risk": "Not a cost/QALY impact directly, but tracks patients in their first quarter after a procedure to apply the appropriate transition probabilities. This helps the model distinguish between first quarter and subsequent quarter transition probabilities."
}
</event_recommendations>

These events cover the key economic impacts in the model while avoiding double counting. Each event represents a distinct mechanism that generates costs or utility impacts. The events are designed to work with the health states and transition probabilities described in the model, capturing both the immediate costs of procedures and the ongoing utility values associated with different health states.

Note that the "First Quarter Post-Procedure Risk" event might be better handled through the transition matrix directly rather than as an Event, but I've included it to highlight the need to track this timing element in the model.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely
2. Then implement it in code using the provided event mechanics

I've noted the details about:
- How to structure the calculation function and EventSpec
- How to use the helper functions for initializing impacts and adding occupancy/flow impacts
- How to add additional parameters if needed using the specified JSON format

I'm ready to proceed with implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Health State Utilities Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will apply appropriate utility values to patients based on their current health state. The utility values represent the quality of life experienced by patients in each health state, which will be used to calculate QALYs.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. For each health state, assign the appropriate utility value multiplied by the cycle length in years
3. Apply these values as QALY occupation impacts

## Health State Utility Assignments
Based on the available parameters and health states:

- **VBT Index Procedure**: Use `preop_utility` as these are patients undergoing the initial VBT procedure
- **Spinal Fusion Index Procedure**: Use `preop_utility` as these are patients undergoing the initial fusion procedure
- **Postoperative VBT**: Use `postop_vbt_utility` for patients who have had VBT and are in post-operative care
- **VBT Revision**: Use `preop_utility` as these are patients undergoing a revision procedure
- **Postoperative Fusion**: Use `postop_fusion_utility` for patients who have had fusion and are in post-operative care
- **Fusion Revision 1**: Use `preop_utility` as these are patients undergoing a revision procedure
- **Postoperative Fusion Revision 1**: Use `postop_fusion_utility` as these are patients who have had a fusion revision
- **Postoperative Fusion Revision 2**: Use `postop_fusion_utility` as these are patients who have had a second fusion revision
- **Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision**: Need to add a parameter for this state's utility

## Parameters Used
- `preop_utility`: 0.783
- `postop_vbt_utility`: 0.925
- `postop_fusion_utility`: 0.875
- `cycle_length_years`: 0.25

## Additional Parameters Needed

<additional_parameters>
[
  {
    "parameter_name": "ineligible_fusion_utility",
    "value": 0.85,
    "description": "Utility value for patients ineligible for further fusion revision",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "Assumed to be slightly lower than postoperative fusion utility due to potential complications or residual issues"
  }
]
</additional_parameters>

## Assumptions
1. Patients in procedure states (VBT Index, Spinal Fusion Index, VBT Revision, Fusion Revision 1) experience the preoperative utility value during that cycle
2. Patients in postoperative states experience their respective postoperative utility values
3. Patients ineligible for further fusion revision experience a slightly lower utility than standard postoperative fusion patients
4. Utility values are applied for the entire cycle length
5. No additional disutility is applied during the procedure states beyond using the preoperative utility value

This event will only handle the utility values associated with being in each health state and will not include any transition-specific utility impacts, which would be handled by separate events if needed.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model.

# VBT Index Procedure Cost Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of the initial VBT procedure as patients enter the VBT Index Procedure state. The cost includes both the device cost and non-device costs associated with the procedure.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Calculate the total cost of the VBT index procedure by adding:
   - VBT index device cost
   - Non-device cost (which covers facility, surgeon, and other procedural costs)
3. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients enter the VBT Index Procedure state

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_index_device_cost`: $50,615.00 (cost of the VBT device for the index procedure)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (non-device costs for all procedures)

## Flow Impact Details
Since this is a cost that occurs when patients enter the VBT Index Procedure state, we need to identify all possible transitions into this state:

1. Model entry: This is a special case as patients start in this state in the VBT treatment arm
2. Potential transitions from other states: Based on the model description, there are no transitions from other states into the VBT Index Procedure state (patients only enter this state at the beginning of the model)

## Handling Model Entry
For patients entering the model directly into the VBT Index Procedure state, we need a special approach since there's no "origin" state. We have two options:

1. Create a dummy "Entry" state that isn't part of the main health states
2. Apply the cost as an occupancy impact for the first cycle only

Since the framework is designed to handle flow impacts for transitions, I'll use option 1 and create an additional parameter to represent the model entry state.

<additional_parameters>
[
  {
    "parameter_name": "model_entry_state",
    "value": "Model Entry",
    "description": "Dummy state representing entry into the model",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "Used to apply costs for initial procedures at model start"
  }
]
</additional_parameters>

## Assumptions
1. The VBT index procedure cost is applied only once at the beginning of the model for patients in the VBT treatment arm
2. The cost is the sum of the device cost and non-device costs
3. No additional costs (e.g., follow-up visits) are included in this event (those would be handled separately if needed)
4. The cost is applied as a flow impact from the dummy "Model Entry" state to the VBT Index Procedure state

This approach ensures that the VBT index procedure cost is applied correctly at the start of the model without double-counting.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

# Fusion Index Procedure Cost Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of the initial fusion procedure as patients enter the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state. The cost includes both the fusion device cost and non-device costs associated with the procedure. This cost applies in two scenarios: (1) when patients enter the model directly into the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state in the fusion treatment arm, and (2) when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Calculate the total cost of the fusion index procedure by adding:
   - Fusion device cost
   - Non-device cost (which covers facility, surgeon, and other procedural costs)
3. Apply this cost as a flow impact in two scenarios:
   - When patients enter the model directly into the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state (from the dummy Model Entry state)
   - When patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200.00 (cost of the fusion device)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (non-device costs for all procedures)
- `model_entry_state`: "Model Entry" (dummy state for model entry)

## Flow Impact Details
The fusion index procedure cost will be applied as a flow impact in two scenarios:

1. From the Model Entry state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state (for patients starting in the fusion arm)
2. From the Postoperative VBT state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state (for patients who initially had VBT but later require fusion)

## Assumptions
1. The fusion index procedure cost is the same regardless of whether it's the initial treatment or a subsequent procedure after VBT
2. The cost is the sum of the fusion device cost and non-device costs
3. No additional costs (e.g., follow-up visits) are included in this event (those would be handled separately if needed)
4. The cost is applied as a flow impact when patients enter the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state

This approach ensures that the fusion index procedure cost is applied correctly both at the start of the model for patients in the fusion treatment arm and for patients who transition from VBT to fusion later in the model.

# VBT Revision Procedure Cost Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of VBT revision procedures as patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state. The cost includes both the VBT revision device cost and non-device costs associated with the procedure.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Calculate the total cost of the VBT revision procedure by adding:
   - VBT revision device cost
   - Non-device cost (which covers facility, surgeon, and other procedural costs)
3. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_revision_device_cost`: $8,804.00 (cost of the VBT device for revision procedures)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (non-device costs for all procedures)

## Flow Impact Details
The VBT revision procedure cost will be applied as a flow impact in one scenario:
- From the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state

According to the model description, patients in the Postoperative VBT state can experience a VBT revision, which would move them to the VBT Revision state. The cost of this revision procedure should be applied when this transition occurs.

## Assumptions
1. The VBT revision cost is the sum of the VBT revision device cost and non-device costs
2. The cost is applied as a flow impact when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the VBT Revision state
3. No additional costs (e.g., follow-up visits) are included in this event (those would be handled separately if needed)
4. The non-device cost is the same for all procedures (index and revision) as specified in the parameters

This approach ensures that the VBT revision procedure cost is applied correctly when patients require a revision of their VBT procedure.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs

# Fusion Revision Procedure Cost Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of fusion revision procedures as patients transition to any fusion revision procedure state. The cost includes both the fusion device cost and non-device costs associated with the procedure. According to the model description, patients can undergo up to two fusion revisions before becoming ineligible for further revisions.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Calculate the total cost of a fusion revision procedure by adding:
   - Fusion device cost
   - Non-device cost (which covers facility, surgeon, and other procedural costs)
3. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition to any fusion revision procedure state

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200.00 (cost of the fusion device)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (non-device costs for all procedures)

## Flow Impact Details
Based on the model health states and description, fusion revision procedures occur in the following transitions:

1. From Postoperative Fusion to Fusion Revision 1 (first fusion revision)
2. From Postoperative Fusion Revision 1 to Fusion Revision 2 (second fusion revision, not explicitly listed in health states but implied in the model description)

Looking at the health states, I notice there's a "Postoperative Fusion Revision 2" state but no "Fusion Revision 2" procedure state. This suggests we need to add a parameter to represent the second fusion revision procedure state.

<additional_parameters>
[
  {
    "parameter_name": "fusion_revision_2_state",
    "value": "Fusion Revision 2",
    "description": "State representing the second fusion revision procedure",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "Added to complete the set of health states for the second fusion revision"
  }
]
</additional_parameters>

## Assumptions
1. The cost of fusion revision procedures is the same for all revisions (first, second, etc.)
2. The fusion revision cost is the sum of the fusion device cost and non-device costs
3. The cost is applied as a flow impact when patients transition to any fusion revision procedure state
4. No additional costs (e.g., follow-up visits) are included in this event (those would be handled separately if needed)
5. The non-device cost is the same for all procedures (index and revision) as specified in the parameters
6. The transition from Postoperative Fusion Revision 2 to Ineligible For Further Fusion Revision does not incur a procedure cost, as these patients are deemed ineligible for further procedures

This approach ensures that the fusion revision procedure costs are applied correctly when patients require revisions of their fusion procedures.

# VBT to Fusion Transition Cost Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of transitioning from VBT to fusion as patients move from the Postoperative VBT state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state. This represents patients who initially received VBT but later require a spinal fusion procedure. The cost includes both the fusion device cost and non-device costs associated with the procedure.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Calculate the total cost of the fusion index procedure by adding:
   - Fusion device cost
   - Non-device cost (which covers facility, surgeon, and other procedural costs)
3. Apply this cost as a flow impact when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200.00 (cost of the fusion device)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616.00 (non-device costs for all procedures)

## Flow Impact Details
The VBT to fusion transition cost will be applied as a flow impact in one scenario:
- From the Postoperative VBT state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state

According to the model description, patients in the Postoperative VBT state can experience an index fusion procedure, which would move them to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state. The cost of this fusion procedure should be applied when this transition occurs.

## Considerations
Upon reviewing the existing events, I notice that this event appears to duplicate the functionality already implemented in the "Fusion Index Procedure Cost" event, which already includes a flow impact from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure". To avoid double counting, we have two options:

1. Modify the "Fusion Index Procedure Cost" event to remove the flow impact from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure"
2. Implement this event but make it clear that it replaces that specific flow impact in the "Fusion Index Procedure Cost" event

For clarity and to maintain the separation of concerns, I'll proceed with option 2 and implement this as a separate event, with the understanding that the "Fusion Index Procedure Cost" event should be modified to remove the duplicate flow impact.

## Assumptions
1. The cost of transitioning from VBT to fusion is the same as the cost of an initial fusion procedure
2. The cost is the sum of the fusion device cost and non-device costs
3. No additional costs specific to the transition from VBT to fusion (e.g., removal of VBT hardware) are included
4. The cost is applied as a flow impact when patients transition from the Postoperative VBT state to the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state

This approach ensures that the cost of transitioning from VBT to fusion is applied correctly when patients initially treated with VBT later require a fusion procedure.

User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state.

# Procedure-Related Disutility Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event will capture the temporary disutility associated with undergoing surgical procedures. When patients transition into a procedure state, they may experience a temporary decrease in quality of life due to pain, discomfort, recovery time, and other factors associated with surgery. This disutility is applied as a flow impact when patients transition into any procedure state.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Define the procedure states in the model:
   - VBT Index Procedure
   - Spinal Fusion Index Procedure
   - VBT Revision
   - Fusion Revision 1
   - Fusion Revision 2
3. Define the disutility values for each procedure type
4. Apply these disutilities as flow impacts when patients transition into any procedure state

## Parameters Needed
Currently, there are no parameters in the available set that specify procedure-related disutilities. We need to add parameters for:
1. Disutility associated with VBT procedures
2. Disutility associated with fusion procedures
3. Duration of disutility (to convert to QALY impact)

<additional_parameters>

  {
    "parameter_name": "vbt_procedure_disutility",
    "value": 0.1,
    "description": "Temporary disutility associated with VBT procedures",

    "standard_error": null,

    "parameter_name": "fusion_procedure_disutility",
    "value": 0.15,
    "description": "Temporary disutility associated with fusion procedures",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "Assumed value representing the temporary decrease in utility during the procedure and immediate recovery period; higher than VBT due to more invasive nature"
  },
  {
    "parameter_name": "disutility_duration_fraction",
    "value": 0.5,
    "description": "Fraction of the cycle during which procedure disutility applies",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "Assumes disutility applies for half of the 3-month cycle"
  }
]
</additional_parameters>

## Flow Impact Details
The procedure-related disutility will be applied as flow impacts in the following scenarios:

1. From Model Entry to VBT Index Procedure
2. From Model Entry to Spinal Fusion Index Procedure
3. From Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision
4. From Postoperative VBT to Spinal Fusion Index Procedure
5. From Postoperative Fusion to Fusion Revision 1
6. From Postoperative Fusion Revision 1 to Fusion Revision 2

## Calculation Method
For each transition into a procedure state, we'll calculate the QALY impact as:
- QALY impact = -1 * (procedure disutility) * (disutility duration fraction) * (cycle length in years)

The negative sign indicates a reduction in QALYs.

## Assumptions
1. The disutility values are constant for all patients undergoing the same type of procedure
2. VBT procedures have a lower disutility than fusion procedures due to being less invasive
3. The disutility applies for a fraction of the cycle (e.g., half of the 3-month cycle)
4. The disutility is applied as a one-time impact when transitioning into the procedure state
5. The disutility is in addition to the lower utility value already assigned to procedure states in the Health State Utilities event

This approach ensures that the temporary decrease in quality of life associated with undergoing surgical procedures is captured in the model, which is important for accurately comparing the overall impact of different treatment strategies.

# First Quarter Post-Procedure Risk Event Conceptualization

## Overview
This event is unique as it doesn't directly apply cost or QALY impacts but instead helps the model track patients who are in their first quarter after a procedure. This tracking is necessary because the model has different transition probabilities for the first quarter after a procedure compared to subsequent quarters. For example, the probability of fusion revision is higher in the first quarter after a fusion procedure (0.0169) compared to subsequent quarters (0.0022).

## Challenge and Approach
The standard Markov model framework doesn't inherently track how long patients have been in a state. To address this, we need to modify our approach:

1. **Tunnel States**: The ideal solution would be to use tunnel states (e.g., "Postoperative Fusion Q1", "Postoperative Fusion Q2+"), but this would require modifying the model structure.

2. **Tracker Event**: Since we're working within the existing framework, we'll create an event that adds a small, negligible "marker" cost to patients who are in their first quarter after a procedure. This marker cost will be extremely small (e.g., $0.0001) so it doesn't meaningfully impact the economic results but allows us to track these patients.

3. **Transition Matrix Adjustment**: The actual different transition probabilities would be implemented in the transition matrix, not in this event. This event only helps identify which patients should have the higher first-quarter probabilities applied.

## Calculation Plan
1. Initialize an empty impact object
2. Identify all transitions from procedure states to postoperative states:
   - VBT Index Procedure → Postoperative VBT
   - Spinal Fusion Index Procedure → Postoperative Fusion
   - VBT Revision → Postoperative VBT
   - Fusion Revision 1 → Postoperative Fusion Revision 1
   - Fusion Revision 2 → Postoperative Fusion Revision 2
3. Apply a negligible marker cost as a flow impact for these transitions

## Parameters Needed
We need a parameter for the marker cost:

<additional_parameters>
[
  {
    "parameter_name": "first_quarter_marker_cost",
    "value": 0.0001,
    "description": "Negligible cost used to mark patients in their first quarter after a procedure",
    "distribution": null,
    "standard_error": null,
    "notes": "This cost is not meant to represent a real cost but is used as a tracking mechanism"
  }
]
</additional_parameters>

## Implementation Notes
This approach has limitations:
1. It only marks patients for one cycle after the procedure
2. It relies on the transition matrix to use this information correctly
3. It adds a small artificial cost to the model

## Alternative Approaches
1. **State Splitting**: A more accurate approach would be to split each postoperative state into "first quarter" and "subsequent quarters" states, but this would require modifying the model structure.
2. **Tunnel States**: Creating a series of tunnel states would allow precise tracking of time since procedure.
3. **Custom Transition Matrix**: Implementing a custom transition matrix function that tracks time since procedure for each cohort segment.

## Assumptions
1. The marker cost is negligible and won't meaningfully impact the economic results
2. The transition matrix will be implemented to use this information correctly
3. The first quarter after a procedure is the only time period that requires different transition probabilities

This event serves as a workaround for the limitation of standard Markov models in tracking patient history within states. While not ideal, it provides a way to implement time-dependent transition probabilities within the existing framework.

User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec
