User:
We are going to work together to code a health economic Markov model in Python. The model will be built using a framework. The framework uses parameters, a transition matrix, Events, and a generic runner. For now, your task is to create a set of Events we can use for the model. To do this, first read the description of Events and their role in detail.

<events_and_their_role>
- In each model cycle, Events are evaluated to determine cost and QALY impacts for that cycle and treatment arm.
- An Event can contribute impacts in two distinct ways:
    - Occupancy impacts: per-patient costs and QALYs accrued while patients occupy particular health states
      (represented as vectors over health states).
    - Flow impacts: per-transition costs and QALYs accrued when patients move from one health state to another
      within the cycle (represented as matrices over state→state transitions).
- Event calculation functions may depend on the model cycle, treatment arm, and model parameters.
- The generic runner combines state occupancies and the model’s transition matrix to convert Event impacts into
  cohort-level costs and QALYs for each cycle, aggregates these over time, and applies all discounting.
</events_and_their_role>

<defining_a_good_set_of_events>
- Each distinct real-world mechanism/trigger should be represented by exactly one Event. That Event may include both
  cost and QALY impacts (and both occupancy and flow components) so the trigger/event rate is calculated once and
  its full consequences are applied together.
- Avoid duplicating the same event-rate logic across multiple Events.
- Overlapping Events that describe the same consequence will result in double counting and must be avoided.
- Events must not attempt to define or reproduce transition probabilities. If a cost/QALY impact is conditional
  on a transition, express it as a flow impact rather than recalculating transition probabilities within the Event.
- Events must only define per-patient cost and/or QALY impacts (via occupancy and/or flow).
  They must not update state occupancies, apply discounting, or implement other model mechanics.
- A good set of Events is not overly granular.
</defining_a_good_set_of_events>

Two simple Events are provided below to illustrate the concept.

<simple_event_examples>
def get_progression_cost_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cost = float(context.params["progression_cost"])
    impact.cost_flow.add("PFS", "PPS", cost)
    return impact

progression_cost_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Progression cost",
    tags={"cost"},
    calculation_function=progression_cost_event,
)

def get_healthstate_utility_impact(context: EventContext) -> EventImpact:
    impact = initialise_impact(context.health_states)
    cycle_length = float(context.params["cycle_length"])
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PFS", float(context.params["pfs_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("PPS", float(context.params["pps_utility"]) * cycle_length)
    return impact

healthstate_utility_event = EventSpec(
    event_name="Health state utility",
    tags={"utility"},
    calculation_function=healthstate_utility_event,
)
</simple_event_examples>

Now, demarcated by <model_description></model_description> is a description of the model.
Demarcated by <available_parameters></available_parameters> is an initial set of parameters (we may add more).
Based on these, devise a list of Events for the model. You should stick to the model description as much as you can, avoid adding extra elements unless these are needed to complete the model.

Return a dictionary where each key is an Event name and each value is a description of the Event.
Return your dictionary in <event_recommendations></event_recommendations> tags.

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs
See provided data. For first index procedures, should be upon entry to the model. 
Revision procedure costs

================================================================================
Assistant:
I'll create a set of Events for the health economic Markov model based on the model description and available parameters.

<event_recommendations>
{
    "Index VBT Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the initial VBT procedure when patients enter the VBT Index Procedure state. Includes both device cost (vbt_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Index Fusion Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the initial spinal fusion procedure when patients enter the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state. Includes both device cost (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "VBT Revision Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of VBT revision when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state. Includes both device cost (vbt_revision_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "VBT to Fusion Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of fusion procedure when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state. Includes both device cost (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Fusion Revision 1 Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the first fusion revision when patients transition from Postoperative Fusion to Fusion Revision 1 state. Includes both device cost (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Fusion Revision 2 Procedure Cost": "Applies the cost of the second fusion revision when patients transition from Postoperative Fusion Revision 1 to Fusion Revision 2 state. Includes both device cost (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).",
    
    "Health State Utilities": "Applies appropriate utility values to each health state based on the patient's current state. Uses postop_vbt_utility for Postoperative VBT state, postop_fusion_utility for all postoperative fusion states, and preop_utility for procedure states. Adjusts for cycle length to calculate QALYs."
}
</event_recommendations>

These events capture the key cost and utility impacts in the model. The procedure cost events use flow impacts to apply costs when patients transition into procedure states, while the utility event uses occupancy impacts to apply appropriate utilities based on patients' current health states. This approach avoids double counting and ensures that each real-world mechanism is represented by exactly one event.

================================================================================
User:
Great. We will now implement the Events you listed, one-by-one. 

We will repeat two steps per Event:
1) Conceptualise the Event precisely 
2) Implement the Event in code.

First, read through the detailed account of Event mechanics below (<event_mechanics></event_mechanics>). Then, read through guidance on how you can add additional parameters to the model if required (<adding_additional_parameters></adding_additional_parameters>). 

<event_mechanics>
- Each Event consists of:
  (1) a calculation function:
        def <get_event_name_impact>(ctx: EventContext) -> EventImpact
  (2) an EventSpec that references it.
- For the calculation function, you should use the following helpers (pre-defined, you do not need to build these)
- impact = initialise_impact(ctx.health_states), to initialise the impact return
- Occupancy impacts:
    impact.cost_occupation.add("<STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost occupancy impact to a state
    impact.qaly_occupation.add("<STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a QALY occupancy impact to a state
- Flow impacts:
    impact.cost_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <cost_value>), to add a cost flow impact to a transition
    impact.qaly_flow.add("<ORIGIN_STATE>", "<DEST_STATE>", <qaly_value>), to add a qaly flow impact to a transition
</event_mechanics>

<adding_additional_parameters>
Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the calculation function of an event. If this is the case, you should add parameters with sensible, assumed values, during conceptualisation. These parameters will then be accessible through the context.params dictionary when you write the calculation function code.

- To add parameters you must include a JSON array within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags as part of your response to the conceptualisation prompt.
- Each element must have the following fields:
    - parameter_name: string
    - value: number or null
    - description: string 
    - distribution: string or null
    - standard_error: number or null
    - notes: string (optional; include only if something is ambiguous)
</adding_additional_parameters>

Acknowledge, and I will provide the first Event to conceptualise and implement.


================================================================================
Assistant:
I understand the process we'll follow to implement each Event:

1. First, we'll conceptualize the Event precisely
2. Then, we'll implement the Event in code

I've read through the Event mechanics and understand how to:
- Create calculation functions that return EventImpact objects
- Use initialise_impact() to create the impact object
- Add occupancy impacts for costs and QALYs
- Add flow impacts for costs and QALYs

I also understand that I can add additional parameters if needed, using the specified JSON format within <additional_parameters></additional_parameters> tags.

I'm ready to proceed with conceptualizing and implementing the first Event you provide.

================================================================================
User:
Now conceptualise the following Event in detail.
Please plan out the calculations you will programme. You should note all of the parameters you will be using, and any assumptions you will make. Importantly, you may be missing some parameters required to produce the generation function. If this is the case, you should use the mechanism described above to add these.

# Conceptual Plan for "Index VBT Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of the initial VBT procedure when patients are in the "VBT Index Procedure" state. According to the model description, index procedure costs should be applied upon entry to the model.

## Cost Components
The total cost of the index VBT procedure consists of:
1. VBT device cost (`vbt_device_cost`): $50,615
2. Non-device costs (`non_device_cost`): $28,616
3. Total cost: $79,231 (sum of device and non-device costs)

## Implementation Approach
Since this is an index procedure cost that should be applied upon entry to the model, I need to determine the best way to implement this in the Markov model framework:

1. **Option 1 - Occupancy Impact**: Apply the full cost to patients who are in the "VBT Index Procedure" state.
   - This would apply the cost in each cycle a patient remains in this state.
   - Since patients spend exactly one cycle in this state (per `index_procedure_duration` parameter), this would apply the cost once.

2. **Option 2 - Flow Impact**: Apply the cost when patients transition from any state to the "VBT Index Procedure" state.
   - This would apply the cost only when patients enter the state.
   - However, since patients start in this state (per initial occupancy), there's no transition into it.

## Decision
I'll use the **Occupancy Impact** approach (Option 1) since:
- Patients start in the "VBT Index Procedure" state in the VBT arm
- They spend exactly one cycle in this state
- This ensures the cost is applied exactly once at the beginning of the model

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_device_cost`: $50,615 (Index VBT device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

No additional parameters are needed for this event.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec

<current_event_description>
Applies the cost of the initial spinal fusion procedure when patients enter the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state. Includes both device cost (fusion_device_cost) and non-device costs (non_device_cost).

Decision Problem
Decision problem statement
The aim of the analysis is to investigate whether VBT (anterior vertebral body tethering) is cost-effective as a first-choice surgical treatment option for pediatric patients with moderate to severe idiopathic scoiliosis who have failed nonoperative management, from a US perspective. The analysis should compare VBT to spinal fusion from the perspective of the US integrated healthcare delivery system (IDS).
Time horizon, cycle length, and discounting
15-year time-horizon, 3-month cycle length. Annual discounting of costs and effects of 3%.
Treatment strategies
Intervention: VBT, comparator: spinal fusion.
Health states
Patients enter the model in the spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state. Devise health states based on the transitions described. 
Transition probabilities
Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure. Once a patient has experienced an index fusion procedure they move to the postoperative index fusion health state. From here, they may experience up to two total revisions (modelled by two further fusion revision health states, with specific post operative states following these). If a patient in the postoperative state for the second fusion revision requires a further revision, they move to the absorbing ineligible fusion state. 
Costs
Index procedure costs

# Conceptual Plan for "Index Fusion Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of the initial spinal fusion procedure when patients are in the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state. According to the model description, index procedure costs should be applied upon entry to the model.

## Cost Components
The total cost of the index spinal fusion procedure consists of:
1. Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost`): $17,200
2. Non-device costs (`non_device_cost`): $28,616
3. Total cost: $45,816 (sum of device and non-device costs)

## Implementation Approach
Similar to the Index VBT Procedure Cost event, I need to determine the best way to implement this in the Markov model framework:

1. **Option 1 - Occupancy Impact**: Apply the full cost to patients who are in the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state.
   - This would apply the cost in each cycle a patient remains in this state.
   - Since patients spend exactly one cycle in this state (per `index_procedure_duration` parameter), this would apply the cost once.

2. **Option 2 - Flow Impact**: Apply the cost when patients transition from any state to the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state.
   - This would apply the cost only when patients enter the state.
   - However, since patients start in this state (per initial occupancy), there's no transition into it.

## Decision
I'll use the **Occupancy Impact** approach (Option 1) since:
- Patients start in the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state in the Fusion arm
- They spend exactly one cycle in this state
- This ensures the cost is applied exactly once at the beginning of the model

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (Fusion device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

No additional parameters are needed for this event.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.

- Any thinking you require

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT Revision Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of VBT revision when patients transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "VBT Revision" state. Unlike the index procedures where patients start in those states, VBT revision is a procedure that patients undergo after being in the postoperative state.

## Cost Components
The total cost of the VBT revision procedure consists of:
1. VBT revision device cost (`vbt_revision_device_cost`): $8,804
2. Non-device costs (`non_device_cost`): $28,616
3. Total cost: $37,420 (sum of device and non-device costs)

## Implementation Approach
For this event, I need to determine the best way to implement the cost in the Markov model framework:

1. **Option 1 - Occupancy Impact**: Apply the full cost to patients who are in the "VBT Revision" state.
   - This would apply the cost in each cycle a patient remains in this state.
   - Since patients spend exactly one cycle in this state (per `revision_procedure_duration` parameter), this would apply the cost once.

2. **Option 2 - Flow Impact**: Apply the cost when patients transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "VBT Revision" state.
   - This would apply the cost only when patients make this specific transition.
   - This is more precise as it captures the exact moment when the revision procedure occurs.

## Decision
I'll use the **Flow Impact** approach (Option 2) since:
- The event description specifically mentions applying the cost "when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to VBT Revision state"
- This approach is more precise for capturing costs that occur at the moment of transition
- It avoids potential issues if the model structure changes and patients could enter the VBT Revision state from multiple sources

## Parameters Used
- `vbt_revision_device_cost`: $8,804 (VBT revision device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

No additional parameters are needed for this event.

Patients enter the model in the index spinal fusion or VBT index procedure health state depending on treatment arm. From this state, patients transition to the postoperative health states. The postoperative VBT health state represents patients who have had an index VBT operation. In the postoperative VBT health state patients who received VBT can experience VBT revision or an index fusion procedure.

# Conceptual Plan for "VBT to Fusion Procedure Cost" Event

## Overview
This event will apply the cost of a spinal fusion procedure when patients transition from the "Postoperative VBT" state to the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state. This represents patients who initially received VBT but later require a spinal fusion procedure.

## Cost Components
The total cost of the spinal fusion procedure consists of:
1. Fusion device cost (`fusion_device_cost`): $17,200
2. Non-device costs (`non_device_cost`): $28,616
3. Total cost: $45,816 (sum of device and non-device costs)

## Implementation Approach
For this event, I need to determine the best way to implement the cost in the Markov model framework:

1. **Option 1 - Occupancy Impact**: Apply the full cost to patients who are in the "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state.
   - This would apply the cost in each cycle a patient remains in this state.
   - However, this approach would double-count costs for patients who start in this state in the Fusion arm.

2. **Option 2 - Flow Impact**: Apply the cost when patients transition from "Postoperative VBT" to "Spinal Fusion Index Procedure" state.
   - This would apply the cost only when patients make this specific transition.
   - This is more precise as it captures the exact moment when the fusion procedure occurs for VBT patients.

## Decision
I'll use the **Flow Impact** approach (Option 2) since:
- The event description specifically mentions applying the cost "when patients transition from Postoperative VBT to Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state"
- This approach is more precise for capturing costs that occur at the moment of transition
- It avoids double-counting costs for patients who start in the Spinal Fusion Index Procedure state in the Fusion arm

## Parameters Used
- `fusion_device_cost`: $17,200 (Fusion device cost)
- `non_device_cost`: $28,616 (Non-device cost for all procedures)

No additional parameters are needed for this event.

================================================================================
User:
Now implement the Event in Python code, exactly as conceptualised.

Requirements:
- Always include the Event code within <final_code></final_code> tags.
- The <final_code> block must contain exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec.
- The Event function name should be stable and descriptive (snake_case, of the form get_<event_name>_impact
- Use context.params["..."] for all parameter values; do not hard-code numbers.
- Please note, to access parameter values, you just need to use the variable name (e.g., params[variable_name], you must not try to access values using 'params[variable_name]["value"]' as the parameters dictionary will be flattened.
- Use occupancy vs flow impacts correctly:
    - Occupancy impacts for costs/utilities that accrue while in a state.
    - Flow impacts for costs/utilities that occur only when a transition happens.


Return only:
- Any thinking you require
- <final_code>...</final_code> with exactly ONE Event function and exactly ONE EventSpec
